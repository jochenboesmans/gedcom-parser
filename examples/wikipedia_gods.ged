1 NAME AAH
1 SEX M
1 NOTE egyptian mythology
1 NOTE Also known as AA, AHAAH: Old Moon God. A shadowy figure who appears to work behind the scenes pulling strings. He's best pals with KHONSU, OSIRIS and THOTH, but seems strangely superior to them. Perhaps 
2 CONC because he rules the 360-day moon calender which governs the year.AAH is best known for gambling away five days of moonlight in a dice game. Because RA had laid a curse upon Sky Goddess NUT, she could 
2 CONC not give birth to a child on any day of any year. So the sympathetic THOTH gambled with AAH and won five days worth of moonlight. (And as any cosmological person will know, moonlight is not measured 
2 CONC in litres or kilograms, but hours and days.) THOTH took this moonlight, divided it into five days and inserted it into the month of July. Because these extra days were not covered by RA's curse, NUT 
2 CONC discovered she could give birth during that time. So ISIS, OSIRIS, HORUS, SET and NEPHTHYS are all July babies. And the year has remained 365 days ever since.  Entry last modified on 12 May 2005

1 NAME ABASSI
1 SEX M
1 NOTE african mythology
1 NOTE ABASSI: Nigerian Creator God and Lord of the Sky. On the suggestion of his wife ATAI, ABASSI invented the first humans and somewhat nervously introduced them into the wild. As he feared, the first couple 
2 CONC quickly discovered sex, and pretty soon were doing their own creating. This created a terrible over-population problem, and made ABASSI feel rather insecure. So ATAI gave humanity two gifts, Argument 
2 CONC and Death, to keep the numbers under control.  Entry last modified on 10 August 2005

1 NAME ABEGUWO
1 SEX F
1 NOTE oceanic mythology
1 NOTE ABEGUWO: Goddess of Rain. The world is her lavatory. ABEGUWO lives in the sky, and whenever she needs to relieve herself she has no inhibitions about letting loose all over the planet. She really should 
2 CONC be called Abiguwee, or perhaps Abigupee. When she takes a pee it's time to get out your umbrella. This might sound a little unsavory, but if you think about it, it could be a lot worse. Better to nice 
2 CONC to her or she'll rain on your parade. And don't even think of challenging her to a pissing contest.  Entry last modified on 05 December 2004

1 NAME ACAT
1 SEX M
1 NOTE mayan mythology
1 NOTE ACAT: God of Tattoos and Tattooing. And we don't mean military ones. The Maya often decorated themselves with body art which was of deep mystical significance. No cheesy anchors or "I luv Prudence" tattoos 
2 CONC for them  they favored designs of the utmost Godliness. Having the symbol of a God tattooed on their flesh would, they believed, give them just the faintest whiff of Godly essence themselves.Tattooing 
2 CONC can be a nerve-wracking business. It's all very well scribbling a wobbly picture of Marilyn Monroe on someone's elbow, but what if you're inscribing the utterly holy face of a God and get the nose 
2 CONC wrong? It's enough to make anyone's hands shake. Luckily tattoo artists can call upon ACAT for assistance. He blesses the ink, the needles, the skin, and the funny buzzing machine. More importantly, 
2 CONC he guides the hands of the tattooist at every stage of the operation  for perfect results every time. We know several tattoo artists who would greatly benefit from ACAT's advice. So if you're thinking 
2 CONC of getting a tattoo, make sure you visit a reputable establishment that's a member of the A.C.A.T. Guild. It's your skin.  Entry last modified on 04 July 2005

1 NAME ACCA-LARENTIA
1 SEX F
1 NOTE roman mythology
1 NOTE ACCA-LARENTIA: Goddess of Fertile Grounds and Real Estate. Formerly a lady of the night in the days before the Roman Empire, she became the mistress of HERCULES after he won her in game of dice. To prevent 
2 CONC gossip, he advised her to get married quick. So she rushed out into the street and bumped matrimonially into Tarutius, an Etruscan property developer. Now Tarutius just happened to own some very 
2 CONC tasty real estate and was not in the best of health. When he died, ACCA-LARENTIA found herself in possession of the entire future site of Rome. What an inheritance! But by a strange twist of fate, she 
2 CONC mysteriously disappeared  leaving the whole lot to the state of Rome itself. This proved very handy for future generations. Whenever some neighboring state protested at city boundaries or Roman occupation, 
2 CONC senators could wave ACCA-LARENTIA's Last Will And Testament in their faces and cry: "Gotcha!" Meanwhile, other legends state she was also someone else: the wife of Faustulus the gamekeeper who 
2 CONC rescued ROMULUS and REMUS. She is also Mother of the LARES, which presumably happened when those famous Roman boundaries were being sorted out. In gratitude for her services, she was given her own festival, 
2 CONC Laurentalia or Larentinalia, on the 23rd of December. At least everyone agrees on the date.  Entry last modified on 27 December 2005

1 NOTE ACHERON: River God. Son of HELIOS and GAIA, he sided with the TITANS against the Gods in the early battles, not actually fighting but lending a hand as a water carrier. ZEUS decided a suitable punishment 
2 CONC was to turn him into water as a tributary of the River STYX leading to HADES, the Underworld.  Entry last modified on 12 February 2004

1 NAME ACHILLES

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE ACHILLES: Heroic son of Peleus and the Nereid THETIS. He was moody, brooding, difficult... but a remarkable hero who got top billing in the Iliad. He was educated at the CHIRON School For Heroes and, 
2 CONC to ensure his heroic status, mum THETIS held him by the foot and dunked him in the River STYX. The sacred waters bestowed all-over invulnerability, but his foot was unaffected. Thence ACHILLES's heel 
2 CONC was the cause of his downfall, thanks to an arrow by the Trojan Paris.  Entry last modified on 12 February 2004

1 NOTE ACHIMI: Buffalo Goddess daughter of Buffalo God ITHERTHER. They were buffaloes long before the herd instinct took effect. They're responsible for hunting and meat-eating, which seems rather daft behaviour 
2 CONC for edible deities. Nowadays it would probably be better to call them Burger Gods.  Entry last modified on 31 December 2002

1 SEX M
1 NOTE mesopotamian mythology
1 NOTE ADAD: Storm God of Thundery Weather. He spends most of his time hurtling around in his chariot littering the skies with forked lightning. He is also a God of Divination, manipulating entrails and rigging 
2 CONC dice to convey future info to the wise. He was one of seventy children and if, as some claim, his mother was ASHERAH, she must have taken a trip to the seaside because his father was some obscure 
2 CONC Sea Deity with a name like 'Prince of the Sea' or 'Deep Sea Doohdah'. ADAD destroyed him anyway with a total wipeout, so we shall never know. ADAD is identified with the Sumerian ISHKUR, and was also 
2 CONC known as HADAD to the Canaanites.  Entry last modified on 28 August 2006

1 NAME ADAM
1 SEX M
1 NOTE middle-eastern mythology
1 NOTE ADAM: The first man, created by GOD in the garden of Eden. Adam's body was formed from the dust of the Earth. Apparently he was the spitting image of GOD himself, and to this day nobody knows if he had 
2 CONC a belly-button or not. GOD gave him the breath of life by blowing up his nostrils, and soon ADAM was frolicking around and naming everything in sight. The population of the world now stood at one. GOD 
2 CONC surveyed the immensity of Earth's lush garden and thought to himself: 'he'll never cut all that grass on his own'. So the first woman was created, to give ADAM a helping hand and kick-start a population 
2 CONC boom. Her name was LILITH and she had issues. The two of them just could not get along. They disagreed about everything  and she refused to sleep with him on the grounds that he was a male chauvinist 
2 CONC wimp. So GOD kicked her out and made a replacement woman named Eve, using material from Adam's spare rib to ensure she was subordinate to him and properly submissive. This could have been the start 
2 CONC of a happy, clean-living human race  with no war, no famine, no strife, and everyone living in peace and harmony for ever and ever. But someone had to come along and spoil it, didn't they? GOD had 
2 CONC planted the Tree of Knowledge in the garden of Eden. Anyone eating the fruit would acquire the knowledge of Good and Evil. In other words, they would instantly develop a conscience. This might seem like 
2 CONC a good thing, but it would lead to independent thinking and choice. Only GOD was allowed to have a conscience. So the Tree was declared out of bounds. Along came the serpent  since identified with 
2 CONC SATAN. He must have been nibbling at the Fruit of Knowledge himself because he knew all about Good and Evil  and frankly he preferred Evil. "Hey, have you tried this?" he said to Eve. "It's really tasty. 
2 CONC And full of vitamin G." So Eve ignored GOD's injunction and took a bite. Wow, that was good. She gave some to ADAM. The serpent watched as their frontal lobes expanded. Higher brain functions evolved 
2 CONC in an instant and suddenly Adam and Eve were capable of independent thought. "OMG, I'm naked!" screamed Eve, and frantically grabbed some fig leaves to cover her modesty. Within two minutes she had 
2 CONC devised the world's first bikini. Then GOD came along. He was very cross. ADAM blamed Eve. Eve blamed the serpent. GOD blamed everyone and banished them all from Eden. Sin had entered the world and 
2 CONC the human race was going to find life very tough from now on. Which seems a little unfair; how could they know they were doing wrong if they didn't know the difference between Good and Evil? They had 
2 CONC to eat the fruit to find out it was wrong to eat the fruit! But that's mythology for you. Despite falling from GOD's favor and taking the entire human race with him, ADAM didn't do so bad. He churned 
2 CONC out more children than you can possibly imagine and lived to a ripe old age of 930.  Entry last modified on 04 July 2005

2 CONC these realms.  But cunning ADAMANTHEA hooked ZEUS's cradle to a tree and, because he was dangling in the space between earth and sky, CRONUS was none the wiser.  Entry last modified on 12 February 2004

1 NAME ADAPA
1 SEX M
1 NOTE mesopotamian mythology
1 NOTE ADAPA: The first human, constructed from wet mud by EA the Creative Water God. That gives you some idea how creative he was. ADAPA's story reveals a valuable lesson: It is not a good idea to tear the 
2 CONC wings off a Wind God. You may think you have reasonable cause if, while out for a day's sailing (your brand new hobby) on the Euphrates River, SHUTU, the aforesaid Wind God, blows you all over the place 
2 CONC and you come close to sinking. But honestly, it's not worth it. ADAPA's display of river rage stopped SHUTU's antics and he was very cross. Despite having the ability to grow new wings almost instantly, 
2 CONC he brought charges and the case went to the Small Claims Court run by ANU the God of Many Parts. When the summons came, ADAPA went to his dad for advice. EA told him to dress sensibly and avoid 
2 CONC any Heavenly food or drink. This was unfortunate advice, as the cuisine on offer came from the Kitchens of Immortality. If he had sneaked a doggy-bag of goodies back to Earth, humans could have avoided 
2 CONC death. Anyway, ADAPA got off with a caution and a bout of community service. He was required to serve as a sage, teaching mortals how wise and wonderful the Gods were, and also explaining to them how 
2 CONC to conduct themselves as decent human beings.   Which largely consisted of warnings not to go sailing when that prat SHUTU was wafting about.  Entry last modified on 16 February 2005

2 CONC in her beauty mode he would be sure to die. What a tease. She also ran an oracle service for priests, offering hot tips for future success in exchange for a little sacrifice. But word got out that 
2 CONC she spent most of her time in a tree as a grey rodent. Someone must have ratted on her. One night, a person or persons unknown cut down the tree. She must have realised she had outstayed her welcome, 
2 CONC as she was never seen again.  Entry last modified on 05 December 2004

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE ADONIS: Handsome God of Desire and Manly Good Looks. Has a very high squeee! factor.For reasons we won't go into, APHRODITE turned his mother Myrrha into a pregnant myrrh tree. When it split and the baby 
2 CONC was revealed, APHRODITE was enchanted. "Ooh, he's gorgeous. I'm saving him for later", she decided. So she put him in a box and checked him in at the Underworld Bank Vault under the care of PERSEPHONE, 
2 CONC who took a quick peek and had the same thought. When ADONIS grew old enough to be 'Gods Gift to Women', PERSEPHONE refused to hand him over. The case went to arbitration and CALLIOPE was asked to 
2 CONC bring about a settlement. Her final judgment was this: For four months of the year, he would live with APHRODITE. Then she must hand him over for four months with PERSEPHONE. For the remaining four 
2 CONC months the choice was up to him. As APHRODITE was the first to find him, she had the first go. Using her girdle of desire, she declared that ADONIS loved only her and PERSEPHONE could take a running jump. 
2 CONC So PERSEPHONE took a running jump to ARES (who was very struck on APHRODITE himself) and said: "Your fancy woman has got herself a mortal lover. And you don't stand a chance, he's absolutely gorgeous!" 
2 CONC ARES was furious, and being of a boorish disposition, changed himself into a boar and killed ADONIS in a hunting accident. This resulted in much hair-pulling and scratching and shrieking in Olympus. 
2 CONC Eventually ZEUS decided it was time for a bit of peace. He declared that ADONIS was not totally dead, but could spend six months with each of them. So now APHRODITE has him in the spring and summer, 
2 CONC and he goes down to the Underworld for autumn and winter. This is why everything fades and gets miserable during the winter months. So the Underworld would seem a good place to choose for a winter 
2 CONC break.  Entry last modified on 12 February 2004

1 NOTE mesopotamian mythology
1 NOTE ADRAMMELECH: Supreme God of the Sun, as featured in the Old Testament 2Kings 17:31Do you know where Sepharvaim was? Then I shouldn't bother. But for the record it was a city which in Old Testament times 
2 CONC had a pretty decent library and was therefore in constant danger of being burnt to the ground. The consort of ANAMMELECH, the Moon, ADRAMMELECH himself was very popular, offering warmth and protection 
2 CONC for the very reasonable price of a few burnt infant sacrifices. We can't say what form his protection took, but as he was a Sun God it was probably sunstroke. When the Sepharvites moved to Samaria, 
2 CONC their Gods went with them. The Sepharvites ended up as good Samaritans, but their Gods were up against some pretty stiff competition. Consequently, ADRAMMELECH appears to have burnt out long ago.  Entry

2 CONC was to populate the Earth  and seemingly half the alphabet. This they did with much enthusiasm. After some centuries, Sky thought they had gone on quite long enough and asked them to choose retirement

2 CONC was something of a split personality, so split himself straight down the middle. Literally. Each half had one eye, half a mouth, one arm, and one leg. But no naughty bits. No half measures for him. The 
2 CONC good half remained in Heaven, while the nasty side became the snaky ADRO and took charge of earthly things. We don't know what the Heavenly half does because, with the division of interests, it didn't

2 CONC These were known henceforth as the Myrmidons. His grandson ACHILLES later led them in battle during the Trojan War. King AEACUS did have trouble with sons. Telamon and Peleus had to be banished 
2 CONC for murdering the third one, Phocus. They wandered off and joined the Argonauts instead. On his death he didn't want to retire, so he was given the job of assistant to RHADAMANTHUS and MINOS, doing a

2 CONC AGAVE went on to marry King Echion and became Queen of Thebes. When Echion died their son Pentheus inherited the throne and AGAVE became a Queen Mum. And all went well until a fully-fledged DIONYSUS 
2 CONC came to visit. He was full of wild and wicked ways, complete with his Cult and Fan Club. AGAVE joined in with fervid enthusiasm as the crazy ravers danced and did disgusting things on Mount Cithaeron. 
2 CONC Pentheus was very unhappy with his mother's licentious behavior and refused to join in  even when AGAVE got the girls (there were lots of girls) to tear his clothes off. With the constant bingeing it 
2 CONC all got out of hand and Pentheus ended up in pieces. Dancing down the road to Thebes with her son's head on the end of a pole, it slowly began to dawn on AGAVE that her high spirits could be misconstrued 
2 CONC and now might be a good time to do a runner. Which she did. Well versed in the ways of royalty, she managed to marry another king and put her debauched ways behind her. She even took in her aged

2 CONC As The Wise Lord and God above all other Gods, AHURA-MAZDA was  and still is  worshipped by Zoroastrians as the Creator of the Universe and Source of All Good Things. With the light bulb reference 
2 CONC seeming so appropriate, we fondly imagine he created the Universe by flipping a cosmic light switch. 'Let there be light', in fact. With the holy AMESHA-SPENTAS and also his sons ATAR and MITHRA providing 
2 CONC backup, AHURA-MAZDA wages permanent war with AHRIMAN, a deity of unspeakable repulsiveness. AHRIMAN aims to devastate the universe by filling it with pure evil. Much like GOD and SATAN, they've 
2 CONC been battling it out for millennia, but AHURA-MAZDA has a trump card tucked up his sleeve; SAOSHYANT will show up at the last minute and put everything to rights. Zoroastrianism was founded by Zoroaster 
2 CONC (also known as Zarathushtra) squillions of years ago, and flourished despite being such an awkward religion to spell. Its sacred scripture, the Vesta, unfortunately perished in the Great Fire at the 
2 CONC Library of Alexandra, and only a remnant of this fascinating text remains. This is called the Zenda Vesta, which means 'Scrap of Vesta Which Is Somewhat Charred But Still Jolly Good'. With its monotheistic 
2 CONC concept of GOD and ideas of good and evil spirituality, Zoroastrianism had a huge impact on subsequent religions such as Judaism and Christianity, who appear to have stolen many of its spiritual

1 NOTE AKER: God of Earth and Guardian of the Gateway of Death. His sphere of action is limited to a tiny patch of the world that joins the east and west horizons of the Underworld. Does this entitle him to 
2 CONC be a horizontal God? His two lion heads face east and west, gazing into tomorrow and yesterday. AKER guards the Gates of Death and lets the Sun God RA through every day. Must be quite a monotonous job. 
2 CONC Presumably he also stops the serpent APEP from escaping into the sky to chase the sun. We have it on good authority that a prayer to AKER can cure snake bites. He's also the God to turn to if you've

1 NAME ALLAH
1 NOTE middle-eastern mythology
1 NOTE Also known as ALAHAALLAH: Arabic Supreme Being and the Almighty God worshipped by Muslims. By all accounts ALLAH is merciful and just, but total commitment is required as he is considered to be the only 
2 CONC true GOD, all others being false and fake. And definitely no pictures, please. He has his own Holy Book of rules and regulations known as the Koran, or more correctly the Qur'an, which was dictated 
2 CONC to his prophet Muhammed via an angel to the sound of bells somewhen in the 7th Century. Now we have to confess we have a slight problem. The Qur'an advises: 'Reflect upon ALLAH's creation, but not upon 
2 CONC his nature  or else you will perish'. This seems to indicate a deep need for privacy which we are reluctant to transgress. On the other hand, the Qur'an also says that the first thing ALLAH created 
2 CONC was the intellect  and that 'a scholar is worth a thousand ignorant worshippers'. It's a tricky dilemma for us humble Godcheckers to grapple with, so we'll just stick to the facts. ALLAH has 3,000 other 
2 CONC names, 1,000 of which are only known to angels. Only the 99 'Most Beautiful Ones' appear in the Qur'an, another 300 in the Torah, 300 in the Psalms of David, 300 in the New Testament and another 1,000 
2 CONC we know not where. We think the Arabic world believed in the safety in numbers principle, being so involved in mathematics at the time. Muslims believe that ALLAH is also the deity known as YAHWEH 
2 CONC and/or JEHOVAH who is worshipped by Jews and Christians. Most Jews and Christians reject this idea, claiming that their own scripture is inviolate and cannot lead to a sequel, no matter how much of 
2 CONC a best-seller it might turn out to be. (However, as that's precisely what Christianity did to the Old Testament, the argument does fall a little short.) The main bone of Christian contention appears to 
2 CONC be that Muslims deny the divinity of JESUS. (Naturally Judaism heartily agrees with that, despite their other theological differences with Islam.) But in fact JESUS does get a very good press in the 
2 CONC Muslim world, being regarded as a Top Prophet along with MOSES, and of course Muhammed himself. With these three religions it seems to us a case of 'so near and yet so far'. We throw our pens down in 
2 CONC despair. If you have any queries, speak to the GOD of your choice, not us. We do not take sides in theological squabbles where monotheism is concerned.  Entry last modified on 09 February 2006

2 CONC TITANS. They planned to steal away HERA and ARTEMIS, and to get a bit of kidnapping practice they abducted ARES and kept him in a bronze pot for thirteen months. If they could do that they could do 
2 CONC anything. HERMES eventually rescued him, but we don't suppose he was in any hurry. Then APOLLO stormed in and used them for a bit of archery practice. They both tried to retaliate by hurling their javelins 
2 CONC at the first thing they saw, which happened to be a doe running between them. The doe smartly sidestepped and they hit each other. These hits were fatal. Their strategy has all the hallmarks of

2 CONC and zoomed off on a tidal wave to the Atlas Mountains in Africa, possibly having a small collision with Atlantis on the way. ("Yes officer, there was a slight bump  I thought it was a speed hump or 
2 CONC something.") POSEIDON didn't chase her but sent Delphinus, King of the Dolphins, to charm her. And well, who can resist dolphins? Certainly not a Sea Goddess. So she swam with the dolphins back to POSEIDON 
2 CONC and they were married. The romance soon went out the window because POSEIDON is such a louse and a cheat. This causes AMPHITRITE to lash herself into furious rages which cause storms at sea. POSEIDON 
2 CONC threatens her with his trident which usually makes matters worse, and only PROTEUS can calm her down with soothing West Winds. P.S. Under the Romans she changed her name to SALACIA.  Entry last

1 NAME AMPHITRYON
1 SEX M
1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE AMPHITRYON: He was a prince who had more adventures than you could shake a stick at. In fact he did once hurl a stick to demonstrate the principles of immortality to a king, with rather disastrous results 
2 CONC as the stick rebounded and killed the king. This is all neither here nor there as he was not a God and it is his connections with ZEUS that merit him a mention. One of AMPHITRYON's ongoing adventures 
2 CONC was to rid the Theban countryside of a child-eating fox which could never be caught or killed. ZEUS, with ulterior motives, lent him a hound called Laelaps, which could catch and kill any animal 
2 CONC it chased. You can see the unresolved equation here can't you? After much amusement at AMPHITRYON's dilemma, ZEUS resolved the matter by turning both animals into stone. This then freed up AMPHITRYON 
2 CONC to chase up some stolen cattle and fight an immortal thief who had one vulnerable hair on his head, which involved some plucking involving the thief's daughter. Whilst all this was going on, ZEUS homed 
2 CONC in on Mrs Amph, who was called ALCMENA, his Tryon outfit duplicating AMPHITRYON to perfection so he could have his wilful way. Did any God have more wilful ways than ZEUS? The resultant proof of ZEUS's 
2 CONC fertility was the birth of HERACLES. When AMPHITRYON put in an appearance as ZEUS was leaving by the back door, ALCMENA was very surprised that he wanted to do it again so soon, but luckily made no 
2 CONC comment. When she gave birth she had twins and HERACLES brother was named IPHICLES.  Entry last modified on 13 March 2004

1 NAME AMUN
1 SEX M
1 NOTE egyptian mythology
1 NOTE Also known as AMEN, AMON, AMMONAMUN: One of the OGDOAD. He started out as the God of Wind and Air alongside his wife AMAUNET. But his remarkable staying power led to him becoming the great Sun God in 
2 CONC charge of everything. He really should be the God of self-publicity, opportunism and always having the last word. Long ago and far away, AMUN went in for mystery and abstract ideas. But he always kept 
2 CONC an eye on progress and was willing to go with current trends and fashions: a hawk's head when they were all the rage, colorful fashion accessories and a beard if they were in vogue. He could be a trendsetter 
2 CONC with his red, green and blue plumed headgear, bracelets and necklets. In his dressing room were heads and tails for all occasions  frog, serpent, ape, lion, ram and even a goose, beetle wings 
2 CONC and claws. You name it, he would get it. He kept a low profile during the hassle of the years when ATEN became a dictatorship, but the moment monotheism was over he leapt back. As with any counter-revolution, 
2 CONC a strong leader is needed, so he stepped in to become the great Sun God of Thebes and his word was law. With his increased importance, it wasn't much of a stretch for AMUN to form an alliance 
2 CONC with fellow Sun God RA. The two deities joined forces and became AMUN-RA. (And note who has top billing there). AMUN's publicity drive also extended to Greece, where he was worshipped under the name 
2 CONC Ammon and had his very own oracle. As an Egyptian God of almost unique holiness and majesty, he's in a league of his own and has interesting parallels with the utterly holy YAHWEH of the Hebrews.The 
2 CONC wandering Israelites must have picked up a lot of cultural tidbits from the Egyptians  and may even have borrowed the idea of monotheism from the short-lived ATEN. But AMUN, whose name means 'what is 
2 CONC hidden', is name-checked on almost every page of the Bible. Whenever 'Amen' crops up at the end of a prayer, he is taking the credit.  Entry last modified on 28 August 2006

2 CONC corporations do today. AMUN, Inc and RA, Corp became the gargantuan AMUN-RA Corporation  slogan: "The Sun in Splendor". With offices all over the continent, profits zoomed through the roof and the Egyptian

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE AMYMONE: Princess with whom POSEIDON had a little fling. Her father Danaus had moved in to rule Argos, which being in a state of drought was up for grabs. He had fifty daughters and decided to send them 
2 CONC off in search for water. Probably because it was cheaper that way. AMYMONE was one of those daughters, but having no luck she decided on a snooze instead. This did not improve her luck as she was molested 
2 CONC by a satyr. She shouted out to POSEIDON for help. He heard her plea and chased the satyr away with his trident. Then he just couldn't avoid showing off to the fair maiden. He struck a rock with 
2 CONC his trident and caused a spring of water to flow forth. Which was fair enough realy seeing as it was him that caused the drought in the first place. Never one to waste a chance with the fair sex, POSEIDON 
2 CONC took over from where the satyr left off. The resulting son was called Nauplius and became founder of the city of Nauplia. This is AMYMONE's only claim to fame and no-one remembers what the other 
2 CONC forty-nine daughters got up to.  Entry last modified on 08 December 2004

2 CONC deity. Particularly one as benevolent as ANAHITA. She looks after the well-being of women, promotes fertility and safe childbirth, and generally makes female life a bit easier to cope with. Perhaps as 
2 CONC a symbol of purity, she is also involved in the water industry and loves to splish and splash in rivers and streams. Perferably ones that are clean and crystal-clear. Her own-label Pure Spring Water

2 CONC Being a bit of a bitch, she zapped him to the Underworld, but he wouldn't let go of the bow and it went with him. This caused no end of problems as it was actually a sky bow which held up the Heavens. 
2 CONC So the sky collapsed and ANATH had to eat humble pie and ask EL to sort it all out  partly through embarrassment and partly because she was going bow-legged under the weight of the sky. She then appears

2 CONC to cause trouble in the Underwater Palace, AO-JUN had a bright idea. He smiled sweetly, gave him a pressie and then complained furiously to the JADE-EMPEROR behind his back. Heavenly retribution was

1 NOTE chinese mythology
1 NOTE AO-KUANG: King of the DRAGON-KINGS. He's in charge of the Eastern Ocean. Regarded as the highest and mightiest of the Four Ocean Dragons, AO-KUANG is majestic, utterly regal and aloof. Despite that, he's 
2 CONC always being pestered by people after a favor. Probably the most cheeky request came from architect LU-BAN, who wanted to borrow his entire palace for a blueprint. And when MONKEY was looking for 
2 CONC a good solid weapon, AO-KUANG's Treasury was his first port of call. After several cups of tea and much frightfully polite haggling, MONKEY chose a huge iron rod which no-one else could lift. This was 
2 CONC the famous Iron Cudgel or Wishing Staff, which DA-YU had used to subdue the Great Flood. It weighted 13,000 pounds and had lain for a thousand years beneath the sea. To be perfectly honest, AO-KUANG 
2 CONC was quite pleased to get rid of it as it was taking up most of the space in his Treasury and making the place look untidy. Despite several early feuds, battles, and complaints to the JADE-EMPEROR, MONKEY 
2 CONC and AO-KUANG did eventually settle their differences to become deadly friends, or the best of enemies. His son and heir AO-PING was killed in a terrible battle with LI-NEZHA, who was supposed to be 
2 CONC killing demons, not dragons. The enraged Dragon King was so horrifically angry that he even considered making an official complaint to the JADE-EMPEROR. Storming from his palace in an awful rage of 
2 CONC revenge, AO-KUANG met LI-NEZHA and was defeated himself. The ultimate humiliation came when LI-NEZHA spared his life but forced him to transform into a blue snake. The poor dragon slithered off, feeling 
2 CONC very impotent and miserable. Life was such a drag for the Eastern Dragon King.  Entry last modified on 15 April 2004

2 CONC God. Animal Welfare God. God of Radiance. God of Ploughing. And much much more! Send for free brochure with no obligation. See him conduct the Holy Choir of MUSES, tickets available at the box office. 
2 CONC Book now for Apollo Space Mission. Also, he has undiminished Beauty and Virility. You name it, he has it. Thoroughly sickening to us mere mortals. But he is not entirely the Mr Nice Guy he would 
2 CONC have us believe. There are women he pursued who won't talk due to transformation or worse. Daphne is now a laurel tree and Clytia is a sunflower. Sudden deaths are not uncommon when he is around  and 
2 CONC don't try to compete with him musically. It's all very well to be played alive but not flayed alive like poor old Marsyas. Or to be given the ears of an ass like poor old King Midas. CASSANDRA never 
2 CONC got another chance either, nor was he very pleasant to the SIBYL-OF-CUMAE, granting her immortality but leaving out the age clause. His son ASCLEPIUS was the result of another unfortunate lapse. Having 
2 CONC had an affair with the mortal daughter of a king, APOLLO was consumed with jealousy when he discovered she had another suitor, and, out of control, he killed her. In a fit of remorse he was just in 
2 CONC time to rescue her unborn child and have him brought up with the best education to be ASCLEPIUS, the Deity Doctor. He met his match in ZEUS, and a tussle for power earned him a period in exile; but as 
2 CONC ZEUS had zapped his son ASCLEPIUS, zapping the Cyclope thunderbolt makers seems justifiable. It can be very tough at the top and all in all APOLLO handles it very well what with ZEUS being his dad, 
2 CONC having ARTEMIS for a twin sister, etc.  Entry last modified on 29 August 2006

1 NOTE AREOP: The Spider Goddess at the beginning of creation. In the great darkness of the void she found a clam shell. What a clam shell was doing in the void before creation is an as-yet-unexplained mystery. 
2 CONC The clam shell was open, and inside was a tiny snail. AREOP was unable to resist having a peek inside, but wham! the shell snapped shut. The snail was now trapped inside. AREOP suggested that the 
2 CONC snail might be able to prise the clam open at the hinge, so the snail went to have a look, leaving a phosphorescent trail behind it. A little white wormy thing was revealed in the light. "Hello, my name 
2 CONC is RIGI," it said. Meanwhile the snail, puffing and straining, was trying to open the shell. "Hey, what's going on in there?" cried AREOP, somewhat confused. RIGI gave her a running commentary, but 
2 CONC the snail's prowess just didn't match up to the likes of the Godchecker Holy Snail. "Let me have a go," said RIGI, and set to work fortified with strength spells and encouraging shouts from AREOP. He 
2 CONC heaved so hard his sweat poured into pools, spread into lakes and finally became the sea. But how the seas and lakes appeared before the earth was created has yet to be explained. This clam is bigger 
2 CONC than you can imagine. Eventually the Big Clunk came and the clam popped open. The lower portion was the Earth, covered in RIGI's sweaty sea, and the top half became the sky. The exhausted snail turned 
2 CONC into the moon, and poor old RIGI, who did not survive the ordeal, was turned into the Milky Way. We're not sure what happened to AREOP after that. We just hope she's not tempted to poke her spidery 
2 CONC nose into the Great Clam again or the sky will come slamming down on top of us.  Entry last modified on 05 December 2004

2 CONC in full flagrante delicto this did not diminish his adulterous activities. The only thing he enjoyed more was war. ARES loved battles and violence. Never mind which side he was on, so long as there 
2 CONC was plenty of blood. His bloodthirsty sons DEIMOS and PHOBOS are in constant attendence, and if all is peaceful, it doesn't take long for his sister ERIS to knock up a little strife. He was not very 
2 CONC popular with most of the other Gods. He sided mostly with the Trojans in the Big Bust Up, and was wounded by a mortal with a little help from ATHENA who blatted him with a rock, and he fled howling 
2 CONC back to Olympus. HERACLES sent him packing with an arrow in the thigh after killing one of his obnoxious offspring, and the ALOADAE held him captive in a bronze jar for over a year because they could. 
2 CONC His mortal sons were so vile HERACLES killed two, Diomedes (see MARES-OF-DIOMEDES) and Cicnus, and APOLLO put paid to another, Phlegyas. Talking of HERACLES, he also dealt with the iron-feathered STYMPHALIAN-BIRDS

2 CONC having turned her into a cow to avoid detection. HERA had already hidden IO in a herd, but she wasn't taking any chances. ARGUS was the perfect security guard as some of his eyes never slept. That was

2 CONC the herd. HERA was most upset when she found the head and in a rare moment of compassion donated the eyes to be used in peacock's tails. Could somebody please do a count? ARGUS also had a surname 'Panoptes' 
2 CONC (He who sees all) which was given to him to avoid confusion with lots of other characters called Argos, and also the Argonauts. Before his untimely end, ARGUS went into the fight business. He

1 NOTE Also known as AGROTORA, AGROTARA, AMARYNTHIA, CYNTHIAARTEMIS: Wild Goddess of Hunting, Animal Liberation, Feistiness and Feminism. She was the result of a wild fling by ZEUS with a lovely lady called 
2 CONC LETO. He was married to HERA at the time, and not wanting his wanton ways to reach her jealous ears, changed himself and LETO into quails. Gods can do that sort of thing. Especially randy ZEUS, who must 
2 CONC have experienced sex in the guise of almost every animal at some time or another. So ZEUS laid LETO, and LETO laid ARTEMIS  and it must have been a double yolker as APOLLO was born at the same time. 
2 CONC Maybe it was the thought of having a sex-mad quail dad that put ARTEMIS off men. When she grew up, she ran off into the wild and took to hunting with a band of women's liberation NYMPHS (particularly 
2 CONC the DRYADS) such as CALLISTO, who joined her with vows of chastity. Despite the hunting, ARTEMIS cares deeply for animals. But she has little respect for human males. When a prowling peeper called Acteon 
2 CONC caught sight of her bathing naked in a pool, she hounded him to death with his own hounds. Then the Great Hunter ORION (who was up to much the same thing) got belted into oblivion with the aid of 
2 CONC a large scorpion. We are not sure how, as eyewitnesses are understandably reluctant to come forward. There are many 'hunting accidents' when the name ARTEMIS crops up. But who wants to point the finger? 
2 CONC It would probably be chopped off. But she wasn't a complete man-hater, as her efforts on behalf of HIPPOLYTUS show.Her temple at Ephesus contained a statue of a female who, it seems, had undergone 
2 CONC breast implants on a multiple scale. She was festooned with them. For a Goddess so keen on keeping her nakedness private, that could just be someone's idea of a joke. But in fact the busty statue was 
2 CONC actually CYBELE, a Goddess known for having lashings of lust (and bloodlust). It must be a feminist thing. Worshippers of ARTEMIS revelled in their womanhood in all its forms. And they still do.In due 
2 CONC course the Romans came and revitalised ritualistic religion. They changed the name of ARTEMIS to DIANA and her public relations were much improved. Now she is top Goddess of the feminist movement  
2 CONC and by far the most requested deity at Godchecker.com. She's also an inspiration to animal rights activists, as long as quails aren't involved.  Entry last modified on 27 August 2006

1 NOTE Also known as ASKLEPIOS, AESCULAPIUS, PAION, PAEON, PAIEONASCLEPIUS: God of Medicine. Also known as Asklepios and Aesculapius, depending whether you are Greek, Roman or dyslexic. He's Dr Deity, having 
2 CONC learnt his stuff from CHIRON (the medical centaur of all healing knowledge), but was struck off the register by a thunderbolt from ZEUS after raising HIPPOLYTUS from the grave. The dead were supposed 
2 CONC to stay dead, and the Gods did not approve of miracle cures. If all the dead came back to life, HADES would be out of a job. So now ASCLEPIUS is a sort of Public Health Service God. Sleep at his shrine 
2 CONC and you can take advantage of his healing dreams. We don't know if any beds are currently available. We have it on good authority that the illegible inscriptions carved on ASCLEPIUS clay tablets were 
2 CONC the very first doctor's prescriptions. Which have remained unreadable ever since. With EPIONE he fathered PANACEA, who attempts to cure with soothing sooths. Panaceas are still used to this day. And

2 CONC the exact geography of the place is a closely-guarded secret. Although brochures of the warrior's paradise VALHALLA are readily available, what goes on in THRUDHEIM and the remaining halls is out of bounds. 
2 CONC The Gods seem to do most of their carousing at their local club, a banqueting hall called GLADSHEIM. They are often to be found hanging out at the Well of Urd to catch up on the latest gossip from 
2 CONC the Three NORNS as they sit in the shade of YGGDRASIL. We live in MIDGARD and below is NIFLHEIM or Deadville. The Norse Gods are mad about the number nine so there are another six regions floating

1 NAME ATEN
1 SEX M
1 NOTE egyptian mythology
1 NOTE Also known as ATONATEN: A minor Sun God who became Top Creator God of the world's first monotheistic religion. Thebes in Ancient Egypt was the bees knees  humming along happily with 500+ deities to choose 
2 CONC from. Until one dreadful day Amenhotep IV came to power. He was obsessed with a little-known Sun God named ATEN. Really obsessed. He changed his name to Akhenaten (He Who Worships Aten) and proclaimed 
2 CONC henceforth there was only one God: ATEN. To prove his point, he abandoned all the old Gods and temples, and moved everyone to a new capital. There he built himself a magnificent new temple and palace 
2 CONC where he could sit in the sun and worship all day long. Priests and suppliers of sacrificial succulents were forced onto the dole as the new religion was enforced. To start with, the new sun disc 
2 CONC God was balanced on the head of HORUS and RA was somewhere in the background. But as time went on, the other Gods were forced out and ATEN became more abstract  just a flat disc with a few ropey rays 
2 CONC emanating from him, very similar to how small children illustrate sunshine. Despite his dedication, Akhenaten let things go sadly to pot, and after seventeen years of monotheism the populace was heartily 
2 CONC sick of it. Being a Pharaoh, there is no way he would have abdicated, but perhaps he succumbed to sunstroke or a slipped disc. The next Pharaoh was the much-revered Tutenkhamen, who restored all 
2 CONC the delightful deities of yore. The world's first monotheistic God was hastily erased from public records. ATEN became ATEN-RA for a mere twinkle, until AMUN nipped in to oust him altogether as AMUN-RA. 
2 CONC Now ATEN is only preserved on disk via computer and gets hardly a mention in the BOOK-OF-THE-DEAD. This is not quite the end. Monotheism was such a momentous concept that it may well have been taken 
2 CONC on board by the Israelites in their great Exodus  along with various Egyptian hymns and prayers. (Some people have even suggested that Akhenaten was actually MOSES himself.) One final twist. Somebody, 
2 CONC possibly even Akhenaten himself, composed a 'Hymn to Aten' which was actually set to music and written down. This, as far as we know, is the first ever example of written musical notation. But what's 
2 CONC the heiroglyphic equivalent of a demi-semi-quaver? Is there anybody out there who can play it?  Entry last modified on 27 August 2006

1 NOTE Also known as ATHAMUSATHAMAS: God of Bringing Up Children, and the ultimate fall guy. Son of AEOLUS and a brother of SALMONEUS and SISYPHUS, he was thick as a brick. ZEUS came knocking at his door looking 
2 CONC for a sucker to marry NEPHELE, the cloned version of HERA. ATHAMAS seemed the ideal choice  he was stupid and not too fussy. Then ZEUS discovered he was having an affair with INO at the same time 
2 CONC as he was doing the same thing with her sister SEMELE. Ever the opportunist, ZEUS blackmailed ATHAMAS into hiding the result of his affair, the baby DIONYSUS, from HERA. What with his own children, legitimate 
2 CONC and illegitimate, ATHAMAS became confused, henpecked and cursed. INO bribed the Delphic Oracle to tell him he must sacrifice his eldest son by NEPHELE, now a teenager called Phrixus, saying 
2 CONC he had raped his auntie. ZEUS saw ATHAMAS on a mountain top altar with knife poised, yelped "Holy Styx!" and was just in time to call HERMES, who leapt onto a fired-up winged golden ram to do a nick-of-time 
2 CONC frightener: "Stop! This is the Child Welfare Thought Police sent by ZEUS. Put that knife down and lie on the ground with your hands behind your head! Failure to comply will mean a pounding to pulp 
2 CONC and after that you will be taken for charging." HERMES then read him his statutory rights. Which were to the effect that his children by NEPHELE would be taken into care, and INO was a crazy biatch 
2 CONC who could no longer be trusted. So ATHAMAS went back to NEPHELE where all hell broke loose; HERA had found out about DIONYSUS and in her anger sent INO stark raving mad. Whereupon INO rushed off wailing 
2 CONC and wandering into the wilderness. Which at least solved one problem. NEPHELE was then snatched back to heaven in cloud formation by HERA, who declared ATHAMAS was too stupid to have a wife. Being 
2 CONC left with INO's two toddlers, he joined a lonely hearts club and met Themisto whom he married  and by whom he had two more children. Yes, he really was that stupid. The calculating HERA then restored 
2 CONC INO's wits. She came back on the scene and ATHAMAS was pig in the middle again. He eventually sent INO packing but was left with all the kids. Themisto, seething with jealousy, did what seems to be 
2 CONC standard behavior in these circumstances. She decided to kill INO's children. And as ever and ever and ever in these situations, she used a Cloak of Darkness to conceal herself, became utterly disorientated, 
2 CONC made a very bad stab at things and  you guessed it  killed the wrong children. Which all goes to prove it is very wrong to kill any children at any time. Now it was ATHAMAS's turn to go raving 
2 CONC mad. He stupidly killed another son by mistake, and tried to make the last one immortal by boiling him. INO was just in time to snatch the small fellow from the pot and run off. Unfortunately it was 
2 CONC night time, they ran too far, and fell off the top of a cliff. ATHAMAS slowly regained his wits, and went back to the Delphic Oracle to ask if he would ever live anywhere in peace, away from any kind 
2 CONC of interference by the Gods. He is now back with Themisto and living in a secret location under the name Smith.  Entry last modified on 22 April 2005

2 CONC  When not on the graveyard shift he likes to party  particularly on Saturday nights which is why he's called Baron Saturday. In his graveyard persona of BARON-CIMETIERE, he watches over cemeteries. 
2 CONC This isn't just a passive role, what with body-snatchers on the look-out for zombie material. As BARON-LA-CROIX, he also stands at the metaphysical crossroads of life and death  and he may even be 
2 CONC a manifestation of GHEDE himself. Of course he might just be a drinking buddy. There are those who claim to have seen them both together, but anything can happen when you drink vast quantities of rum 
2 CONC and hot pepper and trance the night away. Not to mention the odd chicken sacrifice. His wife is MAMAN-BRIGITTE and he also has two colleagues, BARON-LA-CROIX and BARON-CIMETIERE  who may or may not be 
2 CONC aspects of his own grave personality.  Entry last modified on 25 November 2005

1 NAME BAST
1 SEX F
1 NOTE egyptian mythology
1 NOTE Also known as AILUROS, BASTET, UBASTETBAST: Daughter of RA, BAST is the cat-headed Goddess of Fertility, Sensuality and Fire Prevention. She also has a flair for avenging wrongs and is feisty enough for 
2 CONC the Greeks to have identifed her with ARTEMIS.Her official headquarters appears to have been at Bubastis on the Nile Delta, where she had an annual festival. A lot of water has flowed down the Nile 
2 CONC since then and festivals are few and far between. Why not hold your own cat festival? It may do you and your cats the power of good. BAST was a very useful Goddess who performed a vital public service. 
2 CONC In the event of fire, her cat servants would run into the flames to draw out the power. These were the original fire extinguishers. Sadly this practise did lead to a few charred cats. However, cats 
2 CONC were revered in Egypt and we're sure there was no deliberate cruelty involved. After all, with nine lives, they might come back, albeit slightly singed. The Egyptians must have been very grateful for 
2 CONC these fire-fighting services, as dead cats were mummified and sent to join BAST in the spirit world. There's a tendency nowadays to regard BAST as the Goddess of Sex and Lesbians, but that has more to 
2 CONC do with modern sex-kittens. Cats are very sensual animals but you don't want to get scratched. We feel sure it is due to BAST's powers that we now have smoke alarms and catflaps, so never underestimate 
2 CONC the power of the original cat-woman. Be kind to cats. And remember, kind to cats means tough on rats. See also our entry on BASTET, who doesn't really exist.  Entry last modified on 27 August 2006

1 NOTE BASTET: BASTET is the bastardized name of BAST. It's all to do with hieroglyphic confusion and alphabetic pollution. As the Egyptian language changed, some letter-sounds were in danger of losing their 
2 CONC pronounciation. So scribes fought a rear-guard action by nailing extra letters to the ends of words. Thus BAST became BASTET. But the 'et' at the end is, or should be, silent.  Entry last modified on

1 NOTE Also known as WASHER-AT-THE-FORDBEAN-NIGHE: The Washer At The Ford. She runs the MORRIGAN Laundry Service, coming soon to a battle near you. Think scare tactics. An unsuspecting soldier wakes up one morning, 
2 CONC stumbles down to the stream and discovers that his smalls are in the clutches of a frightful hag. The creepy old washerwoman is scrubbing a blood-stained uniform in the stream. His uniform. The 
2 CONC garments drip red into the water and she glares at him with a 'you're next' look in her eye. Then she turns into a crow and flaps off. Result: the poor soldier returns to camp with the sinking feeling 
2 CONC that today's battle won't be going his way. His clothes are sodden, his sword has gone rusty, and crows swirl around looking him straight in his eye. They lick their beaks as the enemy forces surge 
2 CONC into the camp... Gods are not much concerned with domestic duties. When you have incredible power you are not going to fiddle faddle around with the washing up. A swift thunderbolt or flood will get 
2 CONC it out of the way. Gods that do take in washing tend to disguise themselves as hags or crones. It stops those awkward questions. A baleful look and a bucket of blood should be enough to prevent almost 
2 CONC anybody from dumping a shopping trolley in the river. Sadly this aspect of Godliness seems to be in a decline. Where is The Washer at the Ford now? She hasn't been seen for yonks. Does she use a laundromat?

2 CONC worshipped him under the name Baal Zebub, meaning 'Lord of Flies'. Which seems like a strange thing to be Lord of  until you realise that flies carry disease and plague. Anyone who can boss flies 
2 CONC around just has to be respected. See MYIAGROS, for example. But the Hebrew holy men didn't like it. For a start, they were terrified of flies, which were not just dangerous pestilential plague-carriers 
2 CONC but also detestable in the eyes of the Lord. The last thing they wanted was unclean critters buzzing around the Tabernacle. There is a school of theological opinion which suggests that GOD created

2 CONC damage to the king's livestock and BRAN had to offer compensation. When BRANWEN produced a son, Gwern, things settled down for a few years, but then she was suddenly banished to the kitchen and treated

2 CONC when she tied a message to its leg, it made a first class delivery to BRAN. When BRAN got the news he blew his top, raised an army and rushed it to Ireland. There was one of those battles where just about 
2 CONC everyone bit the dust, including BRAN, hit with a poisoned arrow. On his instructions a handful of survivors brought his head home in a magic cauldron (he seems to have had a collection) and he became

2 CONC All they had to do was fetch three magic apples from some distant place, nip to Greece and grab a pigskin of healing, pop on to Persia for a poison spear, do a little deep-sea diving and claim 
2 CONC a cooking spit from Undersea Nymphs and then a magic boar which re-incarnated after being eaten. "And that's it," said LUGH. "When you get back, just pop along to the Hill of Mochaen over there, and

2 CONC pale-skinned figure. He was not feeling well. In fact he had not been feeling well for millions of years. He was lonely, and the unbearable solitude was making him ill. Troubled by a ballooning bellyache, 
2 CONC he staggered, moaned and vomited up the Sun. Light burst forth into the Universe  and he choked out the Moon. The stars came next and then, with a tremendous effort, he threw up the planet Earth. 
2 CONC We do live in a very sick world. This nauseating display was brought to a triumphant conclusion when, as an encore, he vomited forth nine animals, an assortment of humans, and a pile of diced carrots. 
2 CONC Exhausted from his labors, he sat and watched as the nine creatures multiplied. After a while, they had evolved into every living thing on Earth. Which goes to show that Creationism and Evolution 
2 CONC are both right. Apart from a pesky critter named TSETSE-BUMBA, all his creatures were friendly and respectful. His loneliness abated and finally he was content. Then BUMBA's three sons appeared. NYONYE-NGANA,

1 NOTE Also known as ALEXANDRACASSANDRA: Mystic seer and patron of crying wolf. There was once a popular song called 'They Wouldn't Believe Me' which would have made a fine theme tune for this prophetess. It 
2 CONC all started so well. She was the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy. APOLLO thought she was a charming child and let her sleep in his temple with his pet snakes, who licked her ears and 
2 CONC passed on the secrets of prophecy. Was she grateful? Not a bit. She grew to be a very beautiful lady whom APOLLO was smitten with, but it was years before she would grant him as much as a kiss. Him, the 
2 CONC most radiant handsome God ever, who had women swooning in droves! When she did allow him a kiss, that was it. Just one kiss. Nothing else  no cuddling and not a hint of ear-licking. Disappointed, APOLLO 
2 CONC sighed so hard as he tried to prolong the kiss that he dribbled a bit and the power of belief was washed away. Now, no matter what CASSANDRA predicted no-one believed her. "Mad as a hatter!" was 
2 CONC the general consensus. Invasion with a big Wooden Horse? What rubbish! Things went from bad to worse. She could never keep her mouth shut  but whatever she predicted, no-one ever remembered that she 
2 CONC was always right. Even worse, she knew she would come to a bad end including rape, being given away, and finally being murdered by Clytemnestra the epitome of a Greek Tragedy Queen. Of course you may

2 CONC He also attempted to adopt the snake-baby ERICHTHONIUS as a favor to GAIA, but this turned out to be something of a mistake. During his reign there was a dispute between ATHENA and POSEIDON over 
2 CONC the patronage of Attica. CECROPS was asked to mediate. POSEIDON had caused the sea to form a harbour, but ATHENA had planted the first olive tree. CECROPS decided the new fangled olives were best. This 
2 CONC caused POSEIDON to froth at the mouth and cause a nasty tidal wave. This proved a point. Sea was dangerous stuff, whereas olives were a splendid trading commodity, especially in the form of oil. Wise 
2 CONC old CECROPS ruled really well. He established writing, marriage laws and all sorts of civilising influences and did away with human sacrifices. He built the city of Cecrops which later became Athens.

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE Also known as KERBEROSCERBERUS: The Three-Headed Monster Hound who guards the entrance to the Greek Underworld. No-one can enter or leave without getting past him. Another TYPHON and ECHIDNA production 
2 CONC (like his brother ORTHRUS), CERBERUS belongs to HADES and has the disposition of a pit-bull rottweiler in a butcher's shop. Eyes: clear, bright and vicious. Tongue: a healthy red and very slobbery. 
2 CONC Claws: highly polished. Coat: sleek, glossy and reptilian. Tail: poisoned and barbrous. Teeth: er, let's not go into too much detail here. Only HERACLES ever managed to take the Hell Hound for walkies. 
2 CONC In fact only three other beings who weren't dead managed to get past him at all. PSYCHE charmed him with her beauty and a doggie choc. The SIBYL-OF-CUMAE gave him a cake containing a funny substance, 
2 CONC and ORPHEUS lulled him to sleep with his lyre. The Labors of HeraclesEpisode 12: The Capture of Cerberus From the HESPERIDES to HADES, and for his final mission HERACLES was told to bring back the Hound 
2 CONC of Hell  alive! To avoid any long stay complications, which is always a hazard with Underworld visits, first he went through a lot of purification rituals. Then ATHENA and HERMES guided him as far 
2 CONC as the River STYX. When he saw monsters like MEDUSA on the other side he had to be restrained from shooting arrows at them. "They are only phantoms now," HERMES informed him, "you can't harm them, or 
2 CONC they you." So they indulged in some friendly chit-chat instead. CHARON the boatman took one terrified look at HERACLES and decided not to argue the toss. He even waived his usual fee as he ferried him 
2 CONC over in a frenzy of fear. Once across, HERACLES strode to the Gates of Tartarus and found various old friends trussed up in acute discomfort. His attempts to free them were not too successful, but 
2 CONC he did manage to roll a rock of Ascalaphus. Spotting a herd of cattle, he thought a sacrifice to gratify the ghosts might be a good thing. A hellish herdsman was not too happy about this, and a wrestling 
2 CONC match ensued. Herc was just about to crush the ribs of the herdsman when PERSEPHONE appeared. She pleaded for the life of her servant. "Only in return for CERBERUS," demanded our Hero. HADES, attracted 
2 CONC by the rumpus, appeared in a pleasantly compliant mood. "Be my guest. Take our dog for a walk by all means, only you must not use any weapons against him." Chained to the gates was the object of 
2 CONC the quest. CERBERUS, Hell's own watchdog. Having his protective lionskin courtesy of the NEMEAN-LION, HERACLES had no trouble taking the dog in hand. Or rather both hands. He squeezed its three necks 
2 CONC until it stopped slavering poison and lashing its tail, and became meekly compliant. With the dog on a chain it was back to the upper-world at a furious pace. CERBERUS, never having seen daylight before, 
2 CONC was violently sick. From his black bile grew the first Aconite plant. On arrival at Mycenae, King EURYSTHEUS was, as usual, terrified. Even though he was in the midst of a feast, he turned and fled. 
2 CONC The Labors were well and truly at an end. Nobody wanted CERBERUS so HERACLES let it go. It ran whining all the way back to Hell, only stopping for a pee now and then, creating barren patches on which 
2 CONC nothing will ever grow. To see what happened after the Labors, return to the entry on HERACLES…  Entry last modified on 12 February 2004

2 CONC her through Cerynaea, through Greece and into foreign lands, he finally gave up attempting to catch her and decided on the direct approach. Using one of his HYDRAenhanced arrowheads, he exercised 
2 CONC all his marksmanship skills, loosing an arrow that pinioned her front legs together. Her legs went numb, but without harming bone or sinew. The legs then made a fine carrying strap as he travelled back 
2 CONC to Mycenae to present the deer to EURYSTHEUS. ARTEMIS, who'd been waiting to receive the Golden Hind, came to meet our Hero halfway, and was not pleased at the manner of her capture until HERACLES 
2 CONC explained that not a drop of blood had been spilt. "You'll have no trouble kissing her better, and then she'll love you and not run off again," he said. So ARTEMIS forgave him. Next Episode: The ERYMANTHIAN-BOAR…

2 CONC sky pondering on the Meaning of Life. In an inspired moment he created Ale. Stop. Before we go any further we must emphatically deny any association with the Brewing Industry. The Ale created by CHUKU 
2 CONC was Mother Earth. Perhaps it may be better to use her alternative name ALA to avoid confusion. Life and creation were now off to a fine flourishing start. CHUKU was particularly delighted with his 
2 CONC humans, and thought immortality would be a nice prezzie for them. He decreed that any human dropping dead should be laid to rest on Mother Earth ALA and covered with ashes, and restoration would occur. 
2 CONC Sadly some woolly thinking marred things as CHUKU chose a sheep to spread the news. The sheep muffed the message and put it about that dead humans should be burned to ashes and covered with Mother Earth.

1 NAME DAO
1 NOTE chinese mythology
1 NOTE Also known as TAO, DAOISM, TAOISMDAO: The Way. The Great Ultimate. The Secret of the Universe. LAO-ZI said: "It is better not to speak of things you do not understand." But we at Godchecker never let 
2 CONC that stop us. Daoism is a highly philosophical school of Chinese belief, formulated by LAO-ZI in the Sixth Century B.C. and still going strong today. It holds that the Universe, far from being a complex 
2 CONC web of tangled events, is actually very very simple. All forms of matter and being are merely manifestations of YIN and YANG, surrounded by QI energy. To understand and live in harmony with creation, 
2 CONC you must free yourself of all complications and seek 'The Way'. This cannot be found on any road sign, but is located right next to the Path Of Least Resistance. In DAOism, it is better to let things 
2 CONC happen naturally than to strive after them. This is known as Wu Wei. LAO-ZI taught: "The most effective course of action is always to do nothing." Which means The Way cannot be found by seeking it. 
2 CONC All we can suggest is that you find a gentle stream and gaze upon it until your mind is flowing in harmony. If that doesn't work, try reading the Dao-De-Jing (Tao-Te-Ching), which is full of wisdom and 
2 CONC doesn't have any long words in it. The DAOist pantheon of Gods can be somewhat confusing. There is YUAN-SHI-TIAN-ZONG, the unreachable infinite entity, followed by the SAN-QING who are really manifestations 
2 CONC of other Gods or vice versa. Then there is the JADE-EMPEROR who rules over everything and the SAN-GUAN, who also who rule over everything but don't make so much fuss about it. Meanwhile the 
2 CONC EIGHT-IMMORTALS don't rule anything but have lots of fun. All the Gods have their place and the complete pecking order is so complex that even Heaven itself has a job keeping track of it all. But we've 
2 CONC done our best. Note: Thanks to the old Wade-Giles system of transliterating Chinese characters, 'Dao' is frequently written as 'Tao'. Modern Pinyin insists that 'Dao' is the correct spelling, but of 
2 CONC course correcting all the literature would require people actually doing something. Which would be very un-Daoist.  Entry last modified on 27 November 2005

1 NOTE DEGEI: The Great She Serpent. She lived alone in the Sky, although she shared flying space with TURUKAWA, a female hawk. One day the hawk made a nest and laid two eggs, so goodness knows where she had 
2 CONC been skylarking. Intrigued, DEGEI offered to baby-sit and was astounded when the eggs hatched and out popped a baby girl and boy. TURUKAWA seems to have shrugged her feathers and flown off, so DEGEI 
2 CONC became a foster mum. She taught her adopted children everything and made them wise enough to start the human race. Some time later, a group of first generation brothers on hunting practise shot down a 
2 CONC hawk. This hawk turned out to be TURUKAWA. DEGEI decided to punish them with a flood, but she was too kind-hearted to let them drown. Instead she sent down a shaddock fruit for them to use as a life 
2 CONC raft  and a snack for when the flood subsided.  Entry last modified on 16 May 2005

2 CONC fire. Of course, they just had to play with it, until it got out of control and even the mountains caught alight. DARVI, a top Dema, sent rain, but it wasn't working properly due to technical glitches. 
2 CONC But he managed to grab a great chunk of land and heave it into the sea, along with a load of scorched animals. This is why crabs are red and herons have red legs. Indeed anything with red markings 
2 CONC dates back to those scorching days. The chunk of earth is now the island of New Guinea, and the DEMAS are a lot more careful.  Entry last modified on 05 December 2004

1 NAME DEMETER
1 SEX F
1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE Also known as AUXESIA, DEO, CHLOE, SITODEMETER: Known as CERES to the Romans, DEMETER is the Top Earth Goddess of Crops, Harvests, Agriculture and Fertility. She taught nomadic mankind how to plough the 
2 CONC fields and settle down, thus making civilisation possible. Very popular with the rural folk. The daughter of CRONUS and RHEA, she was rather beautiful and the object of many Gods' affections. But she 
2 CONC had a liaison with a mortal prince called Iasion by whom she had two children; PLUTUS, who went on to do well from a financial point of view, and PHILOMENUS who either went on the wagon or invented 
2 CONC it. ZEUS, who'd admired DEMETER from afar, was not happy. When DEMETER sloped off at a Godly Wedding to begin the fling thing, he flung a furious thunderbolt where Iasion happened to be standing. But 
2 CONC before ZEUS could take advantage, the equally horny POSEIDON leapt in. To escape, DEMETER changed into a mare and hid in the herd of King Oncus. But POSEIDON changed into a stallion and she didn't resist. 
2 CONC The result was ARION, a little horse who could speak and had feet. There was also a daughter named DESPOENA, who became something of an Eleusinian mystery. Jealous ZEUS could stand it no longer 
2 CONC and managed to pin DEMETER down for a liason of his own. A daughter was duly born, the beautiful PERSEPHONE. Now it was the turn of HADES to be jealous. One day while PERSEPHONE was playing, the Earth 
2 CONC swallowed her up. When DEMETER found her daughter missing she became demented. Tearing her hair, she ran round in the dark with flaming torches, but could shed no light on what had happened. Then HELIOS, 
2 CONC the Sun God and right old nosy parker, had a quick word in DEMETER's ear. He'd seen everything and told her that PERSEPHONE was now the consort of HADES in the Underworld. Weeping and wailing, DEMETER 
2 CONC wandered far and wide. She refused to send as much as a postcard to the Gods and in her absence crops became crestfallen, wheat withered and livestock limped to a breeding halt. The Gods gnawed 
2 CONC their fingers and beseeched her to return. But she refused to capitulate unless she could see her daughter. One day she stopped for a breather on the palace steps of kindly King Celeus of Eleusis, who, 
2 CONC not realising who she was, employed the poor miserable creature as a nurse and didn't ask for references. Now who should be serving in the palace as a skivvy but IAMBE, the saucy daughter of PAN and 
2 CONC ECHO. Her unflagging sense of humor managed to make DEMETER laugh at last. DEMETER tended to Demophon, the son of King Celeus and Metaneira, who were amazed at how bonny the child became  and were even 
2 CONC more amazed when they found DEMETER about to wrap him in flames. She tried to explain this was only to make the child immortal  but they were not convinced until she turned on a bit of radiance and 
2 CONC revealed her Godliness. Thereupon she was held in great esteem and installed in her own temple at Eleusis. Here she started her very own Secret Society and Mystery Club. It's no good asking about it. 
2 CONC Nobody knows. Not even HELIOS managed to peep through the keyhole. She taught TRIPTOLEMUS, the eldest son of Celeus, to plough and sow and harvest, and gave him air miles vouchers for dragon-powered 
2 CONC chariots to spread the news. Meanwhile, the starving ZEUS sent HERMES to the Underworld for negotiations with HADES and PERSEPHONE. A mother and daughter meeting was agreed, but HADES had a trick in hand. 
2 CONC Because PERSEPHONE had eaten the mystic Underworld pomegranates, she was tied to the realm of death. But a deal was struck and she was allowed out for half the year. DEMETER was so pleased to see 
2 CONC her that flowers bloomed and summer was born. But when PERSEPHONE was summoned back to HADES six months later, DEMETER became very depressed. Leaves fell off the trees and along came the first winter. 
2 CONC And it's been that way each year ever since.  Entry last modified on 27 August 2006

2 CONC on his having invented horse racing. There was no chance of escape and before long DEMETER was with horse and daughter. DESPOENA was the result, but unlike her brother ARION, who took after both parents 
2 CONC in horse mode, she came into the world as a beautiful nymph. However she doesn't easily fit into the usual squadron of NYMPHS as she became something of an Eleusinian mystery.   Entry last modified

2 CONC evil ways, and the plague of misfortunes let loose by PANDORA were causing untold misery. So ZEUS, who was utterly sick of wicked mortals  throwing stones at Heaven, decided to flood the world and kill 
2 CONC them off. Now PROMETHEUS, who kept his ear close to the ground, got wind of this. He advised his son DEUCALION to get into the ship-building industry as a matter of urgency. So DEUCALION, who had recently 
2 CONC married PANDORA's daughter PYRRHA, knocked up a cosy little boat for two, and waited for the tide to turn. It wasn't long before ZEUS set to work, calling down a great deluge which utterly flooded 
2 CONC the Earth. All human inhabitants were drowned (there seems to have been an Olympian get-out clause for all the animals). Only DEUCALION and PYRRHA survived, drifting alone in their makeshift craft 
2 CONC for many days and nights. It was lonely time, with not even a shipping forecast to break the monotony. Finally the waters subsided. They stepped onto dry land and wondered what to do. Consulting the 
2 CONC Oracle of THEMIS for suggestions, they were told to throw their mother's bones over their shoulders. This was not the kind of advice they were anticipating, but that's Oracles for you. Twigging that 
2 CONC 'mother' in this case meant Mother Earth (GAIA), they picked up as many stones as they could manage and tossed them. As soon as they hit the ground, DEUCALION's stones turned into men, while PYRRHA's 
2 CONC became women. The human race was back in business.  Entry last modified on 28 August 2006

1 NAME DIONYSUS
1 SEX M
1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE Also known as BROMIOS, DIONYSOS, DITHYRAMBOSDIONYSUS: God of Sex, Wine and Intoxication. But not necessarily in that order. There are conflicting accounts of his genealogy and conception. The Gods involved 
2 CONC were probably too drunk at the time to remember. But although ZEUS may have had a one-night stand with PERSEPHONE, we plump for ZEUS and SEMELE  on the assumption there is no smoke without fire. 
2 CONC Why else would HERA, the jealous wife of ZEUS, arrange SEMELE's death by insisting he appear before her in all his robes of radiant glory? It was too much for SEMELE who sizzled away to a cinder, leaving 
2 CONC an unborn baby to bounce around in a Godly game of 'pass the parcel'. The bouncing baby got slipped to ZEUS who, full of remorse and guilt, popped it into his thigh. Gods are way ahead of any modern 
2 CONC surgery. When it was born he called it DIONYSUS. HERA called it something else and sent some babysitting TITANS to tear the baby to bits and eat it. RHEA, bless her, managed to save the bits. DIONYSUS, 
2 CONC disguised as a girl, was whisked off to be brought up in secrecy by Auntie INO and Uncle ATHAMAS. Not the best of step-parents. HERA discovered the plot, turned DIONYSUS into a ram and gave him 
2 CONC as a plaything to a band of nymphs. If you think you have troubles, consider being born twice with a dadly birth, not knowing what sex you are, and then suddenly finding you have four legs, horns and 
2 CONC an undetachable woolly coat. DIONYSUS had many wild and woolly adventures until his Godly status became apparent. He put in for a God grant and was given a more befitting body  and a tutor. The tutor 
2 CONC turned out to be a fat boozy, bald old buffer called SILENUS. They got on very well together, and under tuition DIONYSUS made two exciting discoveries. 1) How to make wine. 2) How to make orgasms which 
2 CONC could drive you to the brink of madness. These new ideas brought him an enormous cult following of wild young females (the MAENADS), not to mention his ever-attendant nymphomaniac NYMPHS. DIONYSUS was 
2 CONC a real whizz with women, and set up a special 18-30s Club for them on Mount Cithaeron. At some point he got involved with a Cretan princess named ARIADNE, but they drifted apart when she turned into 
2 CONC a constellation. The next few years were spent in hard drinking, and driving excited females into a frenzy. This drinking and driving got him into a lot of trouble with the authorities. News on the 
2 CONC grapevine warned of police raids and arrests, and even DIONYSUS realised it was time to stagger off to start afresh. So he fled the place, pursued by jealous husbands of the MAENADS, and headed for Rome. 
2 CONC Wishing to be unknown, he changed his name to LIBER for a bit and laid low until he emerged as BACCHUS. With the Bacchae Backup Band recruiting the gang from his former Mad MAENADS, he made a big 
2 CONC attempt to be more user-friendly. The orgy-making was a popular as ever, but by now, with all the debauchery and gluttony, DIONYSUS was starting to look more like the middle-aged and balding boozer SILENUS.

1 NOTE DIOSCURI: Otherwise known as Castor  Pollux, Inc. Are they an engineering firm, estate agents or chemical industrialists involved in genetics? No  they are half-brothers known as the DIOSCURI, although 
2 CONC genetics are very much involved. Both were sons of LEDA, her husband Tyndareos and ZEUS as a swan. Plus two daughters. Here is where it gets tricky as the Godlets were all hatched from an egg. We did 
2 CONC tell you ZEUS was a swan at the time. The egg was a double yolker with CASTOR and his sister Clytemnestra being in Tyn's portion and POLLUX and HELEN with ZEUS's egg on their faces. The DIOSCURI popped 
2 CONC up everywhere doing valiant deeds, saving HELEN from fates worse than death, adventuring with the Argonauts, biffing away in battles and walking off with the prizes at sporting events. They did get 
2 CONC a bit above themselves and assumed they could walk off with anything they wanted. What they wanted at this time were the two daughters of one King Leucippus. So they took them  but he took off after 
2 CONC them, together with the fellows they just happened to be betrothed to at the time. The furious pursuit ended in a savage fracas and CASTOR got diced up, which was a nasty surprise as he found he was 
2 CONC not immortal. POLLUX was only saved from slaughter by ZEUS snatching him up before he bled to death. "He's one of mine!" he roared, "and I invoke the immortality clause!" POLLUX was so upset at his brother's 
2 CONC death, he didn't wish to continue. The only way ZEUS could console him was to let CASTOR be immortal every other day. Which must be somewhat unsettling. You would think this would be an end to 
2 CONC them  but no. All their legendary exploits were exaggerated and expanded until they became Godly Celebrities. The Romans were thrilled to re-cast them in a repeat series with their own catchphrase. By 
2 CONC Castor and Pollux! became a much-used Oath of oafs. They were granted their own equestrian festival on 15th of July, and were given a prime site temple in Rome facing that of VESTA. So don't lose heart

2 CONC and grow bark; they do get to frolic in the forest. Most DRYADS are very shy  and terribly nervous of straying too far from the safety of their tree. But when ARTEMIS comes along, they abandon all 
2 CONC fears and join her hunting expeditions. Not quite immortal, DRYADS live as long as their tree does, which can be a very long time. But when it dies, they perish too  so if you cut down a tree you may 
2 CONC hear its spirit screaming. (We strongly advise you to have a very good reason or revenge will be swift. And make sure you apologise first!)There are many kinds of DRYADS, each associated with a different 
2 CONC species of tree. They include the DAPHNAIE (Laurel Trees), the HAMADRYADS (Oak Trees), the MELIADS (Ash and Fruit Trees) and the OREADS (Mountain Pine Trees).  Entry last modified on 12 December

1 NOTE african mythology
1 NOTE DUBIAKU: Legendary Hero Kid of the Asante people, and the only mortal to outwit Death. Burdened with eleven sons, DUBIAKU's mother couldn't cope and asked the Gods for help. They helpfully sent Death 
2 CONC (who in this unique legend is actually female). When DUBIAKU's mother said: "Dearest son, I'm going out tonight, but nice Mrs Death is coming to babysit", no-one could blame him for being slightly suspicious. 
2 CONC That evening, Mrs Death turned up with eleven of her own children in tow, making it a kind of double babysit. DUBIAKU was on his worst behaviour. He stayed up way past bedtime chewing tobacco, 
2 CONC taking snuff and demanding snacks until Mrs Death didn't know if she was coming or going. She decided to go outside and bang her head against a tree. Meanwhile DUBIAKU got busy. Ten minutes later Mrs 
2 CONC Death returned to the nursery with a sore head and a renewed sense of purpose. She ate the eleven children as she had been asked, and went to kiss her own children goodnight. Too late she discovered 
2 CONC that DUBIAKU had tinkered with the sleeping arrangements and sneaked his brothers out the back where they were hiding in a tree. Mrs Death had just eaten her own children. Cue bad attack of indigestion. 
2 CONC Screeching with rage, she dashed outside to find the missing kiddies. As she stood under a tree scratching her head, the cocky little DUBIAKU peed on her head. Not very clever. Mrs Death looked up 
2 CONC and howled her Falling Down Dead Spell. All the boys fell out of the tree, except for DUBIAKU who had already jumped to escape the spell. Mrs Death climbed the tree to make sure she hadn't missed anyone, 
2 CONC and DUBIAKU turned the tables by shouting the Falling Down Dead Spell word perfect. Mrs Death fell dead. By one of those quirks of fate with which mythology abounds, the tree happened to be on the 
2 CONC banks of the Water-of-Life river. So our young hero splashed his siblings with handfuls of water to restore them to life. In his exuberance he clumsily allowed a drop or two to splash onto Mrs Death, 
2 CONC who sprang up and chased them all. But the boys leapt into the river and swam to safety, all except little DUBIAKU who couldn't swim. In a terrible rage, Mrs Death began throwing stones at the escapees. 
2 CONC She picked up a particularly large one and hurled it towards the opposite bank. But it wasn't really a stone  it was a cunningly disguised DUBIAKU. So the eleven brothers escaped and Mrs Death trudged 
2 CONC home in a foul mood.  Entry last modified on 31 December 2002

2 CONC CETO and PHORCYS (or possibly GAIA and Tartarus). She was a strange mix of a serpent with the head of a woman. According to Milton, she 'seemed a woman to the waist, and fair; but ended foul in many 
2 CONC a scaly fold; voluminous and vast.' But TYPHON obviously fancied her, and she gave birth to most of the classic creatures of horror. Try not to think NEMEAN-LION, CHIMERA, HYDRA, SPHINX(2), MEDUSA, 
2 CONC CERBERUS and ORTHRUS, the Eagle that gnawed PROMETHEUS, Ladon of the HESPERIDES, and various dragons and things. Her children could chew the living daylights out of all but the toughest Heavyweight Champion

2 CONC "... So anyway, I said, I said to her, oooh, I said, I don't believe it, and then she said to me, you won't believe what he said to her, she said, and so I said..." HERA, driven half-insane by the mindless 
2 CONC wittering, removed her power of speech and kicked her out. All ECHO could do then was wander the countryside repeating the last syllable of the last person to give utterance. After falling in

2 CONC picked to rule from was between two rivers  and may have been the greenbelt area later selected for the Garden of Eden. EL is a tricky God to pin down because at the time his name was basically the 
2 CONC universal word for 'deity' in the Middle-East. We're talking Arabic, Hebrew, Ugaric, Phoenician and many more. So when some ancient text reveals that 'El did this' or 'El did that', you're never quite 
2 CONC sure whether it's him or someone else they're talking about. The Urgaric tablets, discovered as late as 1929, are very fragmentary with pieces missing, so much is conjecture. There are Hebrew scholars 
2 CONC who believe EL to have been part of the ELOHIM, who fused himself into one identity to become Eloah, the singular version. This may have led to mono-God status and gotten him into the Old Testament

1 NOTE middle-eastern mythology
1 NOTE Also known as ELOAH, ELYONELOHIM: The Hebrew word for Gods, especially when applied to YAHWEH, the GOD of the Old Testament. Of course Judaism is strictly monotheistic, so you may ask how their One True 
2 CONC God can be possibly be referred to in the plural. He's not a closet polytheist, is he? Or perhaps (as Christians claim) the plural denotes evidence of JEHOVAH's three-Gods-in-one Trinity status. But 
2 CONC no. The word ELOHIM is simply a term used to emphasise YAHWEH's super-divine and ultra-Godly majesty. It's the royal 'we' with magical propensities, and consequently not a word to be tossed around lightly. 
2 CONC Ever-fearful of causing offence, devout Jews could not pronounce it outside of a religious context, or with their heads uncovered. Although they could say 'Eloquim'. Then it did not quite mean 
2 CONC what you knew it meant and sacrilege was avoided. The word seems to have derived from the same place as EL, a common Middle-Eastern word meaning 'God' or 'Lord'. But this was far too generic for the 
2 CONC God of the Hebrews, who wanted to distance himself from all those other ELs running around. So he gave himself another title: YHWH  a word of even more sacred unpronounceabilty...  Entry last modified

1 NAME ENGAI
1 SEX M
1 NOTE african mythology
1 NOTE Also known as EN-KAI, ENKAI, MUGAIENGAI: Supreme Ruling Sky God of the Maasai people  and supplier of all the world's cattle. In the beginning, ENGAI lived on Earth in joyful communion with all the cattle 
2 CONC in the world. Then one day a terrible catastrophe occurred which sent him  and the cattle  zooming off into the sky. (We're not sure what kind of catastrophe, but there was a suspiciously active 
2 CONC volcano nearby.) ENGAI and the cattle tried to live in the clouds, but there wasn't a lot of grass up there to keep the cattle fed. So ENGAI called down to a human named NAITERU-KOP and told him to expect 
2 CONC a special delivery. NAITERU-KOP, who lived near the aforementioned volcano, must have been rather surprised to see a large herd of cattle sliding down to Earth on a vine. Cattle don't usually do 
2 CONC that sort of thing. "Look after them for me," said ENGAI. "They don't like it up here so I'm giving them all to you." NAITERU-KOP was amazed. Look at all those goats and sheep! He was rich! One of his 
2 CONC neighbors was even more amazed  and spitefully cut the rope through sheer jealousy. Thus endeth the Great Cattle Bonanza. But with divinely-granted sole ownership of the entire cattle population of the 
2 CONC world, NAITERU-KOP wasn't complaining. He immediately founded the Maasai, a tribe devoted to cattle. Looking after cattle was their raison d'etre; not just a means of survival but a holy occupation 
2 CONC expected of them by their God. The Maasai are still going strong today  and still believe that all the cattle in the world belongs to them. This gives them the perfect right to rustle cattle from neighboring 
2 CONC tribes. Not cattle thieves but cattle rescuers. As for ENGAI, he's still up there in the clouds, and can veer between two different manifestations. When he's in a good mood (Engai Narok), the 
2 CONC clouds are black and full of nourishing rain. When he's annoyed (Engai Na-nyokie), the clouds are dry, red, and full of life-zapping lightning. When there aren't any clouds, he's probably taking a vacation 
2 CONC at the holy volcano Oldonyo Le Ngai (Mountain of God). When some of the Maasai migrated from Tanzania to Kenya, they found another holy mountain and another manifestation of ENGAI worshipped by 
2 CONC the Kikiyu. See our entry on NGAI for details.  Entry last modified on 23 August 2005

1 NAME ENKI
1 SEX M
1 NOTE mesopotamian mythology
1 NOTE Also known as ENKILENKI: Creator God. And also the first Sumerian God to discover sex whilst he was in his bath. It was such a new discovery he tried it out with his wife NINHURSAGA, and in no time at 
2 CONC all he had a daughter. This was also something new. So in time he had sex with her too, because he didn't know any better  and there were no written rules as he hadn't gotten around to inventing writing 
2 CONC yet. When his daughter had a daughter he did it again. In between times he experimented earth, and rocks and streams and being of a rare God group, sheep and cattle were generated. Soon he had three 
2 CONC daughters Ninsar, Ninkurra and Ninimma, but when a fourth came along NINHURSAGA decided enough was enough and said 'not Utu!' and intervened when he started doing what he always did. Frustrated he 
2 CONC took to doing things with vegetable, but it all backfired when he started eating them and he became very ill. NINHURSAGA who had been refusing to have any more to do with him including cooking his meat 
2 CONC and two veg, took pity nursed him back to health and they went back to square one and had another eight Gods. ENKI then took up another hobby: playing with dolls. Not the inflatable kind, but clay dolls 
2 CONC which he could bring to real life. Although no one likes to mention it, his sexual appetites had not been entirely curbed. By now, and several missing clay tablets later (and these are the only known 
2 CONC narrative source), NINHURSAGA had become Ninmah, and after a night on the beer, possibly another ENKI discovery, they had a clay person-making contest.  This produced some people with bits missing 
2 CONC and handicaps, so they had another competition seeing if they could find them skills rather than throw them away. Thus a blind man became a musician and a man without hands became an attendant on a 
2 CONC king because he could not steal. With the other eight Gods and maybe more perpetrating and breeding and the populace swelling, and new races being formed Godswapping was a popular hobby and the Sumerians, 
2 CONC Akkadians and Babylonians were well into the Godshare business. There was plenty of power sharing and a plethora of ministers, priests, and scribes to draw up laws on clay tablets as calligraphy 
2 CONC took hold. ENKI is now taking a back seat happily engaged in his new capacity as chairman of The Campaign for Real Ale, which involves much sampling of the wares from breweries  Entry last modified on

2 CONC a bit flighty herself, having been cursed with nymphomania by APHRODITE. She made the mistake of fancying ARES, which was the cause of the curse, and instead had to make do with a mortal husband, TITHONUS. 
2 CONC The shame of it. She pleaded with ZEUS to grant him immortality, but forgot about the ageism clause. So poor TITHONUS just got older and older and increasingly withery. Eventually the Gods took 
2 CONC pity and turned him into a cicada. Before this, EOS and TITHONUS did manage to produce two sons, MEMNON and Emathion. These did not bring any benefits. MEMNON got killed by Achilles and Emathion by 
2 CONC HERACLES. So it's not surprising that poor EOS carries on weeping. But this in turn ensures there is never any shortage of dew. In Roman times she was known as AURORA, but we have yet to find a happy

2 CONC occured. A blob landed on ATHENA's thigh and fell to the earth. Such is the fecundity of Gods that a child instantly sprang up from GAIA's fertile soil. GAIA was somewhat irritated by this, as she 
2 CONC hadn't included giving birth in her plans for the day. Particularly not an ugly snaky child as this one was. So she gave the baby, named ERICHTHONIUS, to CECROPS for adoption and safekeeping. As he 
2 CONC also had sprung from GAIA and was a little snaky himself, CECROPS promised to do his best. He entrusted the babe to the care of his daughters in a sealed basket. "But whatever you do, don't look inside!" 
2 CONC he said. The moment you say that, feminine curiosity will prevail. So they peeked. And inside the child was curled up with two cuddly snakes. In fact he appeared to be something of a snake himself. 
2 CONC This gave AGLAURUS, Herse, and Pandrosos such a shock that they leapt shrieking off the top of the Acropolis. They had obviously never seen their father's snaky bits. This should have been the end

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE ERIS: Sister of ARES the War God, ERIS is the Goddess of Strife and Discord. She stole one of the Golden Apples of Immortality, given to HERA as a wedding present by GAIA, and turned it into the Sour 
2 CONC Apple of Discord. What caused the Trojan War? Thanks to ERIS and her apple, it was chaos, confusion and top quality bitching! Miffed at not being invited to the all-star Olympus wedding of Peleus, King 
2 CONC of Thessaly, and Thetis, future mother of Achilles, ERIS sneaked in anyway. There's always a bit of bitchiness among the top Greek Goddesses, but ATHENA and HERA were swanning around quite happily until 
2 CONC ERIS tossed the Golden Apple among them, bearing the label 'For The Fairest'. Well, that upset the applecart. Forget the wedding  this was far more important. Who was the fairest of them all? The 
2 CONC glamorous Goddesses clamoured around ZEUS, asking who it should be. As he was already married to insanely jealous HERA, he wasn't going to fall for that one. Instead he passed the buck. "This question 
2 CONC must be decided by a mortal," he said. And that really started the apple rolling. A dishy guy named Paris was chosen. Speedy messenger boy HERMES whisked them all off to Mount Ida. Paris, good-looking 
2 CONC but crafty, suggested the apple should be shared. HERMES was having none of it. Fly them all that way for a bit of fun and have it fizzle out? No way. "Look here chummy, there has to be a firm choice, 
2 CONC or you'll get a thunderbolt up your whatsit. Do yourself a favor, you great mortal idiot. Go for bribes." So the gorgeous contestants lined up in their Olympic bathing costumes and Paris judged them, 
2 CONC one by one. None of the Goddesses wanted to travel the world and work for charity, so he went for the bribery option. ATHENA offered him Wisdom. HERA offered him Royal Power. But APHRODITE offered 
2 CONC him the most beautiful woman in the whole world, the daughter of ZEUS and LEDA, whose name happened to be Helen. You've sussed it, haven't you? He chose APHRODITE. ATHENA and HERA were furious. But what 
2 CONC APHRODITE didn't tell him was that Helen was already married. To none other than the incredibly butch Greek ruler Menelaus. And Paris, who was a Troy boy, was therefore obliged to abduct her. This, 
2 CONC of course, started the Trojan War, which lasted for ten long-suffering years and caused a severe drain on the world's supply of spears. And all because of a simple piece of fruit! Meanwhile ERIS laughed 
2 CONC like a drain. "That Trojan Horse thing  what a cackle!" she shrieked as she shared the joke with her sisters. Who, we have reason to believe, just happened to be NEMESIS and the FATES. Nowadays ERIS 
2 CONC is held in the highest esteem by Discordians, Pranksters and those who like to set the cat amongst the pigeons. Little wonder that the solar system's 'tenth planet'  discovered in 2005 and the cause

1 NOTE ETAIN: Unfortunate victim of malicious transmogrification and reincarnation. She has certainly done the rounds. She was the second wife of MIDIR, and their marriage caused no little jealousy in the heart 
2 CONC of his ex, FUAMNACH. With a little help from friends, she magically changed ETAIN into a pool of water. MIDIR, very perplexed when his wife went missing, started investigations on a Godly scale. To 
2 CONC keep ahead of the game, FUAMNACH then changed ETAIN into a worm. And then a fly... but whoosh, the fly flew down her throat, and  as happens surprisingly often in these cases  FUAMNACH became pregnant. 
2 CONC Eventually ETAIN was reborn  as a mortal. Growing from a baby into she knew not who, she married a king called Eochaidh. But she really fancied his brother Ailill, which probably caused a little ill-will. 
2 CONC To cut a long story short, one day she met MIDIR again, had a memory lapse in reverse and fancied him something rotten. And vice versa. To untangle the whole marriage confusion, he managed to

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE EURYSTHEUS: King of Mycenae, grandson of PERSEUS and the arch-rival of HERACLES. One day, ZEUS declared that a descendent of heroic PERSEUS could, should and most definitely would become King of Mycenae, 
2 CONC a city of great splendor and power. ZEUS being Top God, his word was immutable, and thus was it so. But not quite the way he intended. ALCMENA's child HERACLES was almost due to be born. He was full 
2 CONC of PERSEUS genes  and just happened to be ZEUS's illegitimate son. Keep it in the family was always ZEUS's motto. But jealous HERA wasn't going to stand for that. She tracked down another possible 
2 CONC candidate in the form of EURYSTHEUS and had a quiet word with ILITHYIA, the Goddess of Childbirth. To everyone's surprise, HERACLES was unexpectedly delayed in the womb and EURYSTHEUS popped out first, 
2 CONC giving him preference in the Kingly stakes. He was thus made the sovereign of Mycenae and also became HERA's grateful stooge as she plotted the downfall of HERACLES. Now for a King with such a noble 
2 CONC heritage, EURYSTHEUS was not only a real creep, but also a cowardy custard. Although delighted to be given the task of killing off his rival by devising the impossibly hard Labors Of HERACLES, any display 
2 CONC of heroics would fill him with dread. So whenever HERACLES returned triumphant, his usual response was to run and hide under the bed. This weasily King did everything in his power to make life impossible 
2 CONC  or preferably non-existent  for his rival. Not content with creating terrible tests, he quibbled over the rules and cheated left, right and sideways. When HERACLES finally left the mortal world, 
2 CONC it was party time at the palace. So it's poetic justice that EURYSTHEUS was eventually killed in battle by the descendents of HERACLES, who took his head home to Herc's grieving mum ALCMENA. She 
2 CONC brightened up at once and used it as a pincushion.  Entry last modified on 12 February 2004

1 NOTE african mythology
1 NOTE Also known as EKURANAEVUS: Drug-induced Trickster God of Irritation if not Evil in the Bwiti religion-cult. MEBEGHE the Creator made the Cosmic Egg, out of which burst NINEPONE and her brother NONE. But 
2 CONC there was also a Cosmic Placenta and Umbilical Cord. (These things happen in drug-induced religions.) The left-over bits formed the body of EVUS, a strangely twisted Godlet with a co-joined twin by 
2 CONC his side. This twin, named Ekurana, possessed the power of thunder. But he spent most of his time sleeping and turning a blind eye to EVUS's goings-on. For EVUS was wayward, annoying, and often very 
2 CONC naughty indeed. Knowing EVUS's nature, MEBEGHE in his wisdom banished him to the jungle to prevent strife. So it was probably him that first discovered the hallucinatory properties of the iboga plant. 
2 CONC Meanwhile NINEPONE and NONE were treated to a nice village setting with all mod cons. EVUS prowled around the jungle growing increasingly bored and dissatisfied. He started to comfort-eat antelopes and 
2 CONC warthogs, and make irritating noises in the dead of night. Finally NINEPONE went out to see what was going on. And found herself unexpectedly seduced. After that things went rapidly downhill. NINEPONE 
2 CONC slept with her brother and EVUS got the blame. EVUS, possibly feeling remorse, taught NONE some useful but very forbidden D.I.Y skills  which made MEBEGHE hate him even more. The end came in a flash. 
2 CONC MEBEGHE gave Ekurana, EVUS's co-joined twin, a prod which finally woke him up. He unleashed a thunderbolt which knocked his brother for six and sent him deep into the bowels of the Earth. We're not 
2 CONC sure if the twins were separated in the process. EVUS is stuck there to this day, but has anyone seen Ekurana lately?  Entry last modified on 05 October 2005

2 CONC Now LOKI, HONIR and ODIN were in deep trouble. LOKI, using all his considerable cunning, suggested a hefty ransom fee to repay his debt. This was agreed and the other two Gods were taken hostage until 
2 CONC his return. Knowing where ANDVARI the Dwarf King kept his treasure, LOKI forced the dwarf to hand it all over, even down to a special gold ring he'd just forged. ANDVARI just had time to curse the ring 
2 CONC so it would bring doom to whoever owned it. LOKI never got to own it  in fear of his life and those of his compatriots he took it straight to the wizards, who released the Gods after a quick gloat. 
2 CONC FAFNIR gloated the most and was so inflamed with greed he turned himself into a dragon and stole the hoard, hiding it in a mountain lair where he could carry on gloating. He killed his father and exiled 
2 CONC his brother REGIN, who by chance ran into the hero SIGURD. The curse was now working overtime. SIGURD ambushed and killed FAFNIR, taking the treasure and pocketing the ring to use for a planned engagement

2 CONC march you to the office of YEN-LO-WANG, the King of Hell. There you are registered, given an identity card, and sucked into the mire of Underworld bureaucracy. No doubt it's all computerised by now.

2 CONC Court 3: Black Rope Hell and the Upside-Down Prison. Ruled by SONG-DI-WANG. Court 4: The Lake of Blood and the terrible Bee Torture. Ruled by WU-GUAN-WANG. Court 5: Sixteen Departments of

1 NOTE chinese mythology
1 NOTE Also known as FUM, FUNJ-HWANG, FUNG-HWANG, FONG-WANGFENG-HUANG: The Chinese Phoenix, one of the four SI-LING Holy Animals. It's often referred to as the Red Bird of the West, and is extremely important 
2 CONC in mystic animalism. Are you sitting comfortably? Preferably under a Chinese woo-tung tree, because that's where the FENG-HUANG is likely to hang out. He must hang out quite a bit because he is six 
2 CONC cubits high. (Cubits are rather vague in terms of measurement but we estimate this is somewhere in the region of nine feet. If you want metric, go and help yourself.) So sitting in the woo-tung tree is 
2 CONC a fairly large creature that will take your breath away. It's difficult to know where to start or even finish. Here are some of the components: A goose-like front with hindquarters of a stag. Neck of 
2 CONC a snake and tail of a fish. A fowl forehead with duck-like down, but the face is like a swallow with the beak of a cock. From the back it is tortoise-like. This beast has dragon markings and furthermore 
2 CONC the body is inscribed with the Five Cardinal Virtues. If you think we've made this up, you can find examples embroidered in the gowns of certain mandarins. The FENG-HUANG presides over the destinies 
2 CONC of the Chinese Empire along with the other SI-LING. It's one of the most sacred animals, in charge of all birds and feathered critters, and represents the South point of the compass. Not content with 
2 CONC that, the FENG-HUANG is also fearsomely sexy and can fan the flames of desire like nobody's business. Try finding a woo-tung tree or a specific type of mandarin and see where it gets you.  Entry last

2 CONC Vibes: Stage 1: First catch your God. Then make sure he points in the right direction. Stage 2: Adjust your Karma with soothing traditional music played on bamboo shoots. Stage 3: Eat a lotus leaf backwards

2 CONC hand. One adventurous day ODIN chanced upon LOKI's monstrous brood. He cast HEL into HELHEIM, and slung JORMUNGAND into the sea, but brought FENRIR the puppy back to ASGARD where an eye could be kept 
2 CONC on him. After all, he might prove useful as a guard dog. TYR was given the job of kennel master, but as FENRIR grew at an alarming rate and became ferociously menacing, it became apparent he could 
2 CONC not be taken for walkies much longer. It was decided FENRIR should be restrained. After twice snapping the chains with which he was entwined with a leer that said 'Now what?', FENRIR caused great alarm. 
2 CONC So the Gods called in the technical experts known as dwarves. Instead of a heavy-duty macho chain, they forged a very slender little ribbon which hardly seemed up to the job. It was fashioned from 
2 CONC the following magical ingredients:The Sound of a Prowling CatThe Beard of a WomanThe Roots of a MountainThe Sinews of a BearThe Breath of a Fishand the Spittle of a Bird.But strangely enough this innocent 
2 CONC little ribbon was infinitely tough and more than enough to keep FENRIR restrained. FENRIR, however, declined to be trussed until TYR placed a hand in the wolfish mouth as a gesture of trust. The 
2 CONC creature was bound over and now has to keep the peace. He also kept TYR's hand which he bit off. When RAGNAROK comes, FENRIR will finally manage to break his bonds and join the giants in their final battle 
2 CONC against the Gods. ODIN will go the way of TYR's hand and be swallowed alive before FENRIR is finally dispatched by VIDAR's avenging sword.  Entry last modified on 29 August 2006

2 CONC is a piscatorial secret known only to those who go fishing for souls. This was definitely catch of the day. Here is FINEGAS very pleased but also feeling slightly druidcidal because he lacks an audience.

1 NOTE FO-HI: The first Supreme Ruler and God-Emperor of China, born about 3,468 B.C. His mother was made pregnant by a rainbow and a white elephant  so we don't quite know what to look for. It would seem that 
2 CONC three nymphs came to do some washing in a river and suddenly a garment bore an image of a lotus in full fruit. This was so realistic that the nymph concerned just had to taste it. (You may think the 
2 CONC lotus is not a particularly edible plant, but who knows what nymphs regard as a delicacy?). There was, as so often in these cases, an immediate pregnancy  followed by a very rapid birth. A boy was born, 
2 CONC complete with rainbow radiance and super aspirations. He went on to do very great things and may even have founded the historical Chinese Empire. In this version, the elephant does not get a mention 
2 CONC  but Chinese elephants are very shy creatures. Just a whisper of 'David Attenborough' and they are off over the rainbow where it is impossible to track them.  Entry last modified on 11 November 2005

2 CONC to put it in modern vernacular  a bit of a goer. She did marry a God called OD, causing much confusion amongst academics and historians who have confused him with ODIN leading to further confusion by 
2 CONC confusing her with FRIGG. (This is why you need Godchecker.) But OD was a bit of a goer himself and nipped out one day for pastures new. This caused much weeping of golden tears, but as usual FREYA made 
2 CONC the best of a bad job and really went off the rails. She ran wild with Gods, mortals, giants and dwarves. The stories and allegations of how she gained possession of Brisingamen, the golden amber necklace 
2 CONC of desire, are scandalous. Especially the one about her bedding four dwarves in turn before they would give it to her. But this sort of thing is just titillation. In any case, the necklace was 
2 CONC stolen by LOKI and  although it was rescued by HEIMDALL  we don't think she got it back. Being a strong-willed warrior maiden, she joined and then led the VALKYRIES  so that she could have first pick 
2 CONC of the slain battlefield warriors. Most of the slain go to VALHALLA, but the good-looking heroes go straight to her palace for rest and recuperation. But FREYA does have a softer side  she loves romantic

2 CONC GAYOMART, anything was better than everlasting boredom. At least he would be provided with a skull to be bored out of. GAYOMART found being a mortal much to his liking  and he was able to indulge 
2 CONC in gardening, the hobby of a lifetime which he had always craved. Starting from scratch and knowing nothing about genetics or germination, it was always full of happy surprises. He was delighted when 
2 CONC one of his finest plants produced a human couple, which he called Mashya and Masyoi. They ran around just like himself after they had been picked. His experiments were viewed with great interest by 
2 CONC AHRIMAN the God of Evil, who was always looking for ways to cause extra misery. At the time he had a girlfiend called Jeh, who also revelled in utmost nastiness. So they killed GAYOMART for fun and took

2 CONC home and allowed LOKI to lead him to his doom, but it was a long journey, and THOR opted for an overnight stay at GRID's. When LOKI was asleep, GRID warned THOR that she had heard on the Giant grapevine 
2 CONC that GEIRROD was up to no good and was on no account to be trusted. She was so concerned, she lent him her own magic belt, iron gloves and unbreakable iron staff. On arrival at GEIRROD Castle, THOR 
2 CONC used GRID's gifts to great effect. The host was not there when they arrived, and THOR, still tired after a sleepless night, dozed off in a larger chair. The gruesome twosome daughters crept under the 
2 CONC chair and heaved upwards to crush THOR against the ceiling. THOR snapped awake just in time to wedge the staff between himself and the ceiling. Then he too became pushy. Pushing down beat pushing up 
2 CONC and THOR broke their backs and crushed them to death.GEIRROD didn't appear until breakfast next day, when he acted as if nothing had happened. Then with no warning he seized a lump of red hot iron from 
2 CONC a brazier and hurled it at THOR who, on the alert, caught it in the iron gloves and returned the favour with interest, bringing down a pillar supporting the roof before rebounding through GEIRROD's

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE Also known as GERYONES, GEYRONGERYON: A monstrous three-in-one deal. You've heard of beasts with nine heads and monsters with six arms? Well GERYON went to the extreme. He had three whole bodies. From 
2 CONC the waist down he was just your average ugly giant running around on two incredibly butch legs. From the waist up, there were three of him. Three muscular torsos, three macho belly-buttons, three pairs 
2 CONC of bulging biceps, and finally three insanely leering heads with wildly terrifying hair. We suspect he also had three sets of foul-mouthed tattoos. The Labors of Heracles Episode 10: The Cattle Of 
2 CONC Geryon Having delivered the Girdle of HIPPOLYTA to Mycenae, it was time for the last Labor. And, noted HERACLES with relief, this time it was back to the beasts. Much easier to deal with than warrior 
2 CONC women. So, GERYON was not only a giant but also acknowledged as the strongest man alive. (We don't know who calculates these record-breaking statistics, but surely having three bodies is cheating?) He 
2 CONC lived on the island of Erytheia, beyond the Straits of Gibraltar  and practically halfway to the Edge of the World as far as HERACLES was concerned. And the mission this time was to steal GERYON's famous 
2 CONC herd of red cattle. In a surprising break from tradition, these had no nasty qualities whatsoever, but were guarded by Eurythion, a son of ARES, and ORTHRUS, a two-headed monster hound from the TYPHON 
2 CONC and ECHIDNA production team. Travelling to Erytheia was not so easy in those days, and HERACLES had many a warming-up adventure, including too much warming by Sun God HELIOS as he travelled the 
2 CONC Libyan Desert. Our champion had to stick him with an arrow before they came to an agreement. Considering the circumstances, HELIOS was amazingly amicable and gave our Hero a huge golden bowl which was 
2 CONC big enough to be used as a boat. Floating in his bowl, eventually HERACLES reached his destination: Mount Abas. And in a flash it was over. Biff! One barking-barking monster dog done for. Splat! Eurythion 
2 CONC out of the equation. Sploof! One arrow poisoned with HYDRA blood straight through the three bodies of GERYON. Then HERA tried to intervene again. But Herc wasn't having any of that and she went 
2 CONC howling back to Heaven with an arrow in her right breast. Then it was a rip-roaring cattle drive with more adventures than you could spin a lariat at. ZEUS shouted "That's my boy!" and  gave a little 
2 CONC aid when no-one was looking. HERA made one last attempt with her famous Gadfly, which was the size of a sparrow and had a vicious dagger-like sting. The terrified cattle dispersed in all directions and 
2 CONC took a very long time to round up again. But eventually HERACLES returned to Mycenae, ten labors down and triumphant. Phew! All missions accomplished and game over. Or was it? Next Episode: The Apples

1 NAME GOD
1 SEX M
1 NOTE middle-eastern mythology
1 NOTE GOD: The one and only Lord God Almighty of monotheistic religion. But which religion? There are several  and although they all agree that there is only One True God, they can't seem to agree much on anything 
2 CONC else. The world's major monotheistic religions kicked off in the ancient Middle-East, a volatile place where nation begat nation like you wouldn't believe  and war, commerce and chaos were never 
2 CONC far away. With peoples and tribes swarming all over the place, the Middle-East was overloaded with competing Gods. In fact it was a classic environment for the process of Natural Selection  and 'survival 
2 CONC of the fittest' ensured that only the very best Gods evolved to prosper down the millennia. (If you can't cope with the idea that the existence of God proves Darwin's Theory of Evolution, you'll 
2 CONC just have to put up with it.) Apart from a brief fling with AHURA-MAZDA, the first mono-God to make a lasting impression was YAHWEH, the God of his chosen people the Israelites. (Let it be noted that 
2 CONC they didn't choose him, he chose them. That instantly set him apart from just about every other God we can think of.) Brooking no rival, he demanded non-stop attention, being a self-confessed Jealous 
2 CONC God (Exodus 20:4). And if jealousy can be a divine attribute then paranoia and vindictiveness may also get a look-in. The Hebrews may have respected him, but he wasn't exactly chummy. Then something 
2 CONC happened which changed religion forever. JESUS was born  and not only was he a nice guy with stunning revelations, he was also the first religious figure to really understand the importance of psychology, 
2 CONC love and a good photo-opportunity. Much to the distress of the Jewish people (particularly the High Priests), YAHWEH was given a holy makeover and became JEHOVAH, a somewhat more approachable God 
2 CONC for all nations. After the rise of Christianity, JEHOVAH enjoyed Top God status for a while  until Muhammad came along with a whole new slant and explained that YAHWEH and JEHOVAH were really just alternative 
2 CONC versions of ALLAH, and Blessed Be His Name. Which was enough to drive the Christians into a fighting frenzy of Holy Wars. As if all that isn't confusing enough, you have to realise that these 
2 CONC (supposedly definitive) monotheist religions are full of splinter groups, sects, factions, cliques, schisms and in-fighting. When it comes to the attributes of God and the best way of worshipping him, 
2 CONC no-one can agree on anything  and you can count yourself lucky if the discussion doesn't terminate in explosions. There are so many different views of the One True God, it sometimes seems to us that 
2 CONC all those schisms and sects are really a desperate yearning for the good old days of polytheism. Which is probably the ultimate irony.  Entry last modified on 24 July 2005

2 CONC and ZHU-RONG, claiming victory, ascended to Heaven for a lap of honor. GONG-GONG was so humiliated at this defeat that he decided to kill himself by head-butting one of the pillars of Heaven. This

2 CONC this instance we are left trying to come to grips as to why THOR should hurl the toe of some unfortunate minor God called AURVANDIL into the sky to become a star. It is true that THOR had been hit 
2 CONC on the head after a battle with the giant HRUNGNIR and had fragments of whetstone embedded therein. This is where GROA becomes involved. As a seeress with healing powers she had been summoned to charm 
2 CONC the fragments from THOR's head. Also she had been the wife of AURVANDIL. We are now no longer at a total loss. According to a report by an onlooker at the time, THOR was telling GROA how he knew her 
2 CONC old man, and once when they were stranded in the Kingdom of the FROST-GIANTS he had to carry poor old AURVANDIL home in a basket because he had frostbite in his toes. Sadly the toes had to be amputated, 
2 CONC and to cheer up his old mate, THOR hurled them into the sky to become stars. GROA, who had never heard this story, was so excited and enthralled she stopped her incantations, and then could not remember

1 NOTE chinese mythology
1 NOTE Also known as CHUAN-YIN, KUAN-YIN, KWAN-YINGUAN-YIN: Goddess of Compassion and Caring, and one of the Four Supreme BODHISATTVAs of Chinese Buddhism. GUAN-YIN's mission is Victim Support. She supports 
2 CONC the distressed and hungry, rescues the unfortunate from peril, and gives comfort and aid wherever it is needed. GUAN-YIN's work would put many a charity to shame  and she doesn't ask for donations. Otherwise 
2 CONC known as AVALOKITESVARA in India, she had finally attained Enlightenment after much non-struggling with non-things. She was just about to enter Heaven to join the other BUDDHAS when she heard 
2 CONC the cries of the poor unsaved souls back on Earth. Her heart touched by pity, she vowed never to rest until every single soul was brought to Buddhahood. The magnitude of contemplating this task made her 
2 CONC head explode into a thousand pieces, but she was perfectly fine after BUDDHA gave her a few Aspirin Sutras. Turning aside from Heaven, GUAN-YIN went to the sacred island of Potuoshan and embarked on 
2 CONC her new career. This selfless sacrifice brought her much credit, and reverence which persists to this day. As a deity often called upon to appear in the most unusual and difficult situations, GUAN-YIN 
2 CONC has the ability to transform into any living thing. In fact she's better known in India as a male. But she often appears in female form to avoid gossip  and because she likes it. Like her Japanese 
2 CONC equivalent KANNON, GUAN-YIN is known as a female deity, and has taken on a modest amount of fertility work. Childless women pray to her for offspring. In this respect she is also a Goddess of Rice, filling 
2 CONC it with her own milk to give nourishing tit-bits. The Bodhisattva who saves us from the Three Calamities and the Eight Disasters, GUAN-YIN is always on call, and has appeared in many a Chinese tale 
2 CONC to help the likes of MONKEY out of tricky situations. His  or her  peaceful benevolence has soothed many a worried brow. We are full of admiration.  Entry last modified on 28 August 2006

2 CONC As told in Romance Of The Three Kingdoms, he started life as a mortal vendor of soya bean curd (see TO-FU). But after a heroic incident involving the rescue of a harrassed lady and the killing 
2 CONC of a tax inspector, he got the taste for battle and embarked on a famous military career with LIU-BEI and ZHANG-FEI, becoming one of the Three Brothers of the Peach Orchard. Unusually for a God of War, 
2 CONC he uses his skill to avoid confrontations if at all possible. A peace-loving deity, he tries to minimize every battle he's in. (Surely you've heard of Kung Few?) But his bravery is legendary. In one 
2 CONC famous tale, his arm was damaged in battle and needed surgery. To the incredulity of on-lookers, he calmly sat playing Solitaire while field surgeons did excruciating things to his tendons. (Just as 
2 CONC well Solitaire is a one-handed game.) When he was finally captured, GUAN-YU was told by Wu, the evil new Emperor, to change sides or face death. GUAN-YU not only refused, he uttered a terrible insult 
2 CONC which made even the soldiers blush. Loyal GUAN-YU knew that changing sides during a war was not only immoral but also against the Law. For his bravery, and because he died defending legal issues, he also 
2 CONC became the patron God of Police Officers. Legend tells that after he died, GUAN-YU appeared before a meditating Master of Buddhism and asked for spiritual guidance. Which was only natural under the 
2 CONC circumstances. Quickly learning the Five Precepts, he became a Buddhist, reached Enlightenment, and now devotes the rest of his Immortality to defending the faith. A completely honorary position, but 
2 CONC extremely well-regarded. Finally, GUAN-YU is also worshipped as a God of Literature  because he managed to read a whole page of Confucius without going cross-eyed.  Entry last modified on 12 November

2 CONC by bounding hares. We like to think it's all the same one. He's hare today and there tomorrow, zig-zagging and madly dancing through so many cultures. The Chinese Hare In The Moon, the Mad March Hare 
2 CONC of Wonderland, and Brer Rabbit of North America (definitely a hare in rabbit's clothing). Even the ancient Maya had a rabbit scribe, who  judging by illustrations of the time  has a wild hare-like 
2 CONC gleam in his eye. Differention between species seems somewhat vague. And so we come to the Yoruba HARE of Africa. He starred in one of the first Hare and Tortoise fables, one of the few occasions when 
2 CONC the trickster was out-tricked. Many of his stories were taken verbatim to create Brer Rabbit. In Yoruba culture HARE head-dresses with bunny ears were worn in celebratory ceremonies. Cute.  Entry last

1 SEX F
1 NOTE egyptian mythology
1 NOTE Also known as HERETHATHOR: Egyptian Goddess of Happiness, which seems to have been in short supply in that part of the world. As protector of women, she's often described as a cow, but she is far more 
2 CONC than that: she is seven cows all at once. Have you ever heard of such a thing? The mother of ANHUR under the name Heret, she certainly put herself about a bit. She was certainly a Goddess of great complexity, 
2 CONC associated with love, fertility, naughtiness, moon, music and cavorting. She has more associations with whatever was going on than you could shake a sistrum at. As a welcome passenger on the 
2 CONC RA cruises, she had the hots for RA or vice-versa. You never know with Sun Gods. Once when RA was being jeered at by Earthlings for looking frail after a heavy night, she took up a cudgel on his behalf. 
2 CONC  There was a rampage of frazzling which wiped out half the humans in the Nile Valley. She vowed to come back and take care of the rest after a weekend break. Initially flattered, RA was now horrified. 
2 CONC To prevent further carnage he made secret arrangements with the brewing industry. Seven thousand jugs of red beer were poured into the Nile to look like blood of the slain. Intrigued by the vast 
2 CONC red lake, HATHOR stopped to peer at her red reflection. A finger to the lips of the image, and a little lick. Mm, tasty. One thing lead to another and as predicted the biggest one-Goddess binge of all 
2 CONC time was under way. Some time passed before HATHOR woke up. She could remember very little. If there was any carnage it was nothing to do with her but she remembered she'd set out on this enterprise 
2 CONC in the company of SEKHMET. She couldn't remember drinking all that beer, and that was probably SEKHMET as well.  It was a pity that all the witnesses appeared to be dead. If it would help to compensate 
2 CONC for any distress, she would be willing to donate a generous proportion of her Godly time to take on the duties of Revelry and Quaffing. Furthermore she would also undertake the planning of the Nile 
2 CONC Floods, so important to Egyptian agriculture. This could easily be calculated as she represented the Dog Star Sirius and, according to THOTH, if Sirius rose before the sun or some such thing, flooding 
2 CONC was imminent. Sorted. Now HATHOR was popular and endearing and not given to ripping people apart. Whereas SEKHMET was liable to bouts of being bloody-minded. We can only go with the theory that it was 
2 CONC a prank that got out of hand thanks to SEKHMET.  Entry last modified on 28 October 2003

2 CONC of silt and sediment flow through it each year, giving the Huang He its distinctive yellow color and making it a poor choice for washing your socks in. Although the Great DA-YU took care of the Great

1 NOTE Also known as HEKATEHECATE: Goddess of Hidden Wisdom, Change and Darkness. She's also the Queen of Witches. But HECATE is not the evil hag that popular legend suggests. In fact she seems to have started 
2 CONC out as HEKET, the Egyptian Goddess of Childbirth. Her considerable power over nature ensured her continued popularity, but she's never fitted in with the crowd. Any crowd. She's very much her own Goddess.Her 
2 CONC role and attributes are hard to sum up in a few words. She has the power of change, whether for good or evil, and is the one invoked when spells are cast. A good lunar calender is essential 
2 CONC as the power she gives is related to the phases of the moon. That's why it's best to start new projects when there's a full moon. (If nothing else, at least you'll be able to see what you're doing.) 
2 CONC HECATE is often seen with three heads: dog, horse and lion (or snake). These symbolise the attributes of SELENE, ARTEMIS and PERSEPHONE (but not necessarily in that order), as HECATE is something of a 
2 CONC three-in-one Goddess in the attribute department. Over the centuries, her esoteric nature has led to a lot of misunderstandings and bad press. The modern conception of a wicked cackling witch with broomstick 
2 CONC and warts is more or less the result of early Christian anti-HECATE propaganda. (After all, any decent witch could cure warts in a jiffy.) Trivia: HECATE was known by the Romans as TRIVIA.  Entry

2 CONC them BRIAREUS, The Vigorous, COTTUS, The Furious and GYGES, The Big-Limbed, the parents decided they had done enough and hurled them to the world below the Underworld. There they stayed for a million 
2 CONC or so years knowing no better life, until the time came when CRONUS put paid to the fatherhood of URANUS and the big Gods vs TITANS dust-up started. Mother Earth GAIA was trying to be neutral, but she 
2 CONC kept getting stomped and trampled on by both sides. She moaned to ZEUS that this wouldn't happen if her lads were around because they'd love their mum if she told them to. ZEUS, needing all the help 
2 CONC he could get, nipped down to see the lads with a goodly selection of Godly liquid refreshment to win undying support. Selecting BRIAREUS as the spokesman (as he could mumble more coherently than the 
2 CONC others), ZEUS managed to cut out some of the repetitive responses as the giants had fifty heads apiece without a decent brain between them. Eventually the unanimous 'Yurse!' was taken to be an oath of 
2 CONC allegiance. In action the brothers had the mindless violence and loyalty that ensured victory for the Gods, and as a special reward ZEUS said they could go back to the lowest Underworld and guard such 
2 CONC TITANS as had surrendered. That would have been the end of the matter if one day ZEUS hadn't got in a spot of bother. APOLLO, HERA and POSEIDON had ganged up on him with enough grievances to cause 
2 CONC rebellion and had tied ZEUS to his bed with a hundred unbreakable knots of cord.Somehow ZEUS managed to sneak a trunk call to the Underworld and BRIAREUS came storming to the rescue like a dog to its 
2 CONC master. If a dog resembled a very large tree that is. Wagging his branches and not knowing the knots were unbreakable, he snapped them without thinking and stood by as ZEUS drew up some oaths of loyalty 
2 CONC from the rebels. BRIAREUS thought he wood (all his thoughts were wood) be offered a new job as a minder for ZEUS, but by the time this thought had sapped slowly through his heads he was back with his 
2 CONC brothers guarding the TITANS again. He is still trying to figure out why he is not still in Olympus. It is a knotty one and brings him out in knotholes. "I coulda been a contender," he mumbles.  Entry

2 CONC One of these seals was LOKI. He'd stolen the necklace and retreated to the safety of an obscure sea-bound rock in the guise of a seal. Blending in with the seal population was proving somewhat 
2 CONC difficult, but it was his best chance to avoid detection. The other seal, having sat quietly on the rock for several hours with hardly a glance in his direction, hauled itself up, brushed itself 
2 CONC down and unexpectedly punched LOKI in the face. It was HEIMDALL, come to rescue the necklace. He'd disguised himself as a seal, positioned himself on the rock first and lulled LOKI into the most embarrassingly

1 NAME HEPHAESTUS
1 SEX M
1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE Also known as HEPHAISTOSHEPHAESTUS: Son of ZEUS and HERA, he's the Lame Blacksmith God. "Well," said the disappointed HERA, "with legs like those he is never going to play for Olympus," and tipped him 
2 CONC over the edge of a cloud. He fell into the sea but two Goddesses, EURYNOME and THETIS, rescued him. They taught him to make seaside souvenirs from seashells and coral and he turned out to be an amazing 
2 CONC craftsman... and graduated from this to greater and grander things. Apart from his ugly mug and withered legs, he became a muscular hunk. With his strength went strength of purpose and he went for 
2 CONC Blacksmithery in a big way. If you can run an underwater forge you have unassailable skills. Such was his fame, he was allowed back to Olympus and ZEUS had him making thunderbolts and supervising the 
2 CONC CYCLOPES when the war with the TITANS was in full swing. Peace came and with it new demands as he could make just about anything: clockwork tables, armour of invincibility, wrought iron pub signs and 
2 CONC robotic statues. He even got to marry APHRODITE; quite a consolation  even if she did cheat on him a lot. But he did have a small revenge when he caught her and ARES in-flagrante in a net of his own devising 
2 CONC and put them on display for a bit. This made him even more popular. For all his strength he is not a God to go about causing trouble and smiting folk. Like his works, he is well-tempered, and 
2 CONC has acted as a role model for smithery the world over. The Romans couldn't wait to commit forgery and sign him up as VULCAN. If you wish to know more about his products please send for the catalogue.

1 NAME HERA
1 SEX F
1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE HERA: Mrs ZEUS. Supreme Greek Goddess and the Queen of Olympus. She's also a Goddess of Marriage and Birth, which is somewhat ironic considering that her notoriously unfaithful husband ZEUS produced an 
2 CONC incredible number of illicit offspring with an entire pantheon of lovely ladies. If he wasn't liasing with LETO and LEDA, he was getting friendly with DANAE, THEMIS or MNEMOSYNE  all behind HERA's back. 
2 CONC He used every trick in the book to mislead and divert her away from his affairs. See our entry on ECHO for an example. Although as regal as they come, HERA is not the most Godly of Goddesses. She 
2 CONC can be spiteful, vicious and extremely jealous, but who can blame her with all the carrying-on ZEUS did? Their arguments and fighting make Mount Olympus shake to its roots. And when HERA starts throwing 
2 CONC the Holy Crockery you know it's time to make a rapid exit. Even ZEUS is scared of his formidable wife. After seeing what she did to his illegitimate son HERACLES we can understand why. The one time 
2 CONC he managed to get the better of her by force, by chaining her to a mountain with horrifically heavy weights, ZEUS didn't hear the end of the matter for centuries. No wonder he spends most of his time 
2 CONC delayed at the office. We have to admire HERA's strength and determination. She certainly gives as good as she gets. And if you're lucky enough to be in her good books, she can be wonderfully gracious 
2 CONC and charming. But she's best avoided at parties unless you happen to be carrying a sacred pomegranate in your pocket.  Entry last modified on 14 November 2005

1 NAME HERACLES
1 SEX M
1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE Also known as HERAKLES, ALCIDESHERACLES: Not a God to start with. Just an old-fashioned heavy. The Sylvester Stallone of Greek mythology, in fact. Just because he (Heracles, not Stallone) was begotten 
2 CONC by ALCMENA and ZEUS, it didn't mean he had Godly status. After all, ZEUS did put it about a bit, and his wife HERA was terribly jealous. (You might be a descendent of his for all you know. Put in an 
2 CONC immortality claim and see what happens.) HERACLES means 'Hera's Glory', but after she drove him mad and forced him to kill his own children it was more like Gory. HERA detested most of ZEUS's extra-marital 
2 CONC kids, but she hated HERACLES with a divine vengeance and plotted the most evil plots against him. (See EURYSTHEUS.) Poor Herc, reeling from the murder of his children, went to the Oracle of APOLLO 
2 CONC for psychological counselling and was told that a bit of physical labor would take his mind off things. Thus began The Labors Of Heracles. These tasks, in truth devised by HERA and implemented by his 
2 CONC arch enemy and rival EURYSTHEUS, lasted many years  and were designed solely for the purpose of wiping him out. But he didn't know that. "Complete those Labors and immortality shall be yours," the 
2 CONC Oracle had said, and poor Herc didn't know any better. So he went off and battled monsters, cut heads off things, stole Golden Delicious apples and had adventures which were far too exciting to be related 
2 CONC here... while EURYSTHEUS taunted him and tricked him and cooked up devious schemes to trouble him. The Labors Of Heracles (in 12 volumes) First Labor: The NEMEAN-LION Second Labor: The Lernean HYDRA 
2 CONC Third Labor: The CERYNEIAN-HIND Fourth Labor: The ERYMANTHIAN-BOAR Fifth Labor: The AUGEAN-STABLES Sixth Labor: The STYMPHALIAN-BIRDS Seventh Labor: The CRETAN-BULL Eighth Labor: The MARES-OF-DIOMEDES 
2 CONC Ninth Labor: The Girdle Of HIPPOLYTA Tenth Labor: The Cattle Of GERYON Eleventh Labor: The Apples Of The HESPERIDES Twelfth Labor: The Capture Of CERBERUS Although HERACLES succeeded in every quest, 
2 CONC this only made HERA hate him the more. The poor guy travelled everywhere doing his best to right wrongs, but she plagued him with storms and evilness for many years afterwards. Finally, after many 
2 CONC more adventures, including being sold as a slave, becoming a pirate and fighting for Olympus against the giant sons of the TITANS, he died in a mix-up over a magic potion, and was accidentally tainted 
2 CONC with the blood of the HYDRA from one of his own arrowheads. But as a reward for all his trials and tribulations, he was offered a grudging kind of immortality and a share of the film rights. Reconciled 
2 CONC to HERA at last, he married her daughter HEBE and now lives happily ever after. And then did it all over again for the Romans under the name HERCULES...  Entry last modified on 27 August 2006

1 NAME HERMES
1 SEX M
1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE HERMES: Messenger of the Gods. He's also the God of Merchants and Commerce, Athletics and Travel, Public Speaking, Shepherds and Thieves. Quite a mixed bag. The son of ZEUS and MAIA, he was barely a day 
2 CONC old before he was stealing sheep, bartering goods and contemplating the small print of manufacturers' warranties. Born in a cave and finding his mum asleep, HERMES toddled off to see what was what. 
2 CONC What he found was a herd of cattle, and innocently decided to take them home to play with. He didn't know they belonged to APOLLO but, instinctively realising that adults can be a bit funny, covered 
2 CONC their tracks anyway. APOLLO went ballistic when he found 50 cattle missing and no clues. He offered a reward for information. Eventually someone mentioned they had heard music from a cave in the district. 
2 CONC APOLLO investigated and found two cow hides stretched to dry at the entrance. Inside was a sleeping woman with a baby. MAIA, when roused, was incredulous. "My little HERMES? He's only two days old!" 
2 CONC But the little cherub was quite non-plussed. "Yes, I took them," he admitted. "There's only two missing. I killed 'em as a sacrifice to the Twelve Gods of Olympus." "Twelve Gods?" queried APOLLO. 
2 CONC "Who is the Twelth?" "Er, your servant, I think it is going be me. Did you know ZEUS is my dad..?" "Aww, isn't he a cheeky little chap?" said ZEUS as HERMES faced judgment. "A chip off the old block indeed. 
2 CONC Well APOLLO, there's no harm done if he returns your cattle and promises not to do it again. Take him back and sort it out." APOLLO sullenly agreed and whisked HERMES back to the cave, where the 
2 CONC baby Godlet attempted to placate him. "The herd is round the corner, here are the two cow skins... Oh, and I also used some cow gut to make this." HERMES produced a small lyre made from a tortoise shell, 
2 CONC and played a few amazing chords using a plectrum (another HERMES copyright). As a musician, APOLLO was very impressed indeed. He just had to have these two musical items. So he offered the cattle 
2 CONC in exchange. HERMES agreed and, as they started talking music, cut some reeds into pan pipes so they could have what may have been the world's first jam session. APOLLO was enthralled and had to have 
2 CONC the pipes as well. He offered his golden cattle-herding staff in exchange. "I dunno," said HERMES, scratching his head, "you seem to get the best of all these bargains. An old staff for a precision 
2 CONC instrument like this? Still, you can really blow, man. How can I deny such a groovy musician as you?" So they became music buddies, and APOLLO took HERMES back to Olympus where all was happily resolved 
2 CONC and HERMES successfully pursued his claim for Godly status. His gift of the gab made him the perfect choice for messenger duties. ZEUS made him a Herald and kitted him out with a winged hat and sandals. 
2 CONC Powered by these he can zoom all over the place delivering news that's worse than it sounds. The staff he used may be the one he traded with APOLLO. HERMES then made a vow to ZEUS: "I will never 
2 CONC tell lies  although I cannot promise always to tell the whole truth." Despite wheeling and dealing by the seat of his pants, HERMES always manages to leave his customers perfectly satisfied. Mostly due 
2 CONC to his incredibly cunning sales talk. He's such a persuasive salesman he could sell pyramids to the Egyptians. (Wait! He already has!) Those sandals make him fleet of foot and an expert runner, which 
2 CONC is why he's also the God of Racing and Athletics. Perfect for chasing after new clients. Or running away from old ones. His dodgy dealing tactics were also passed down to his son AUTOLYCUS. Under the 
2 CONC Romans he changed his name to MERCURY and floated himself on the stock market. See also PRIAPUS.  Entry last modified on 28 August 2006

2 CONC in the Premier League. Following in their father's footsteps, they successfully negotiated the tricky tests of hell and challenged the XIBALBA team to a match. From the kick-off it was a tough one. The 
2 CONC twins ignored the ball and kicked the life out of the monsterous VUCUB-CAQUIX and his two giant sons CABRAKAN and ZIPACNA. But CAMA-ZOTZ the Bat God was passed a knife and managed a magnificent header 
2 CONC by lopping HUNAHPU's head off. The game seemed to be a draw, so the brothers asked for extra time. HUNAHPU borrowed a turtle's head, whilst his own head took an early bath and was hung above the court 
2 CONC to dry. Nevertheless the head still managed to participate in the heading, which really threw the Underworld side. They were totally disorientated in the last minute when XBALANQUE caught the head 
2 CONC and kicked the turtle top knot into touch. Victory to the HERO-TWINS! XBALANQUE replaced HUNAHPU's head so you couldn't see the join. "How do you do that?" asked the defeated team. "That's us," grinned 
2 CONC the twins, "we always stick together. Chop anything off and we just stick it back". The losers pleaded for a demonstration. So the brothers chopped them into pieces. But they decided against the joining

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE Also known as HESPERIDSHESPERIDES: Three Golden Ones. The three NYMPHS, daughters of NYX and EREBUS, who look after the very rare apple tree Golden Immortalitus, not to be confused with Golden Delicious. 
2 CONC This shines with the golden radiance of a glorious sunset, which is why the HESPERIDES are also Sunset Goddesses. The Golden Apples were given to HERA as a wedding present by GAIA. Trouble-maker ERIS 
2 CONC stole one, and to preserve the rest HERA planted them in a beautiful garden. A Golden Apple tree grew there, and along flounced some nymphs to nibble at the fruit. Wagging a warning finger, HERA put 
2 CONC a dragon called Ladon on guard duty. The nymphs took one look at his hundred slavering heads and turned over a new golden leaf. From that moment they devoted themselves to tending the tree. HERA tended 
2 CONC not to trust them but Ladon was there to prevent any scrumping. AEGLE does the shining, HESPERA does the watering (she was also known as Arethusa but took on an alternative name to avoid confusion 
2 CONC with the well-known nymph), and ERYTHEIA pores over the best times for pruning and picking. HESTIA pops in from time to time to tend the flowerbeds. The HESPERIDES are best of friends with ATLAS, who 
2 CONC is a close neighbor. Some legends even claim he is their father by Hesperis. Other legends give ZEUS the credit, and one or two cynical folk claim the HESPERIDES are simply a flock of golden sheep. 
2 CONC The Labors of HeraclesEpisode 11: The Apples Of The Hesperides HERACLES had originally been sentenced to Ten Labors. Returning in triumph with the Cattle of GERYON, he was hoping to take a well-deserved 
2 CONC vacation. But the mean-minded EURYSTHEUS claimed two of the Labors were null and void. "That HYDRA business  your nephew did half the work, and there seems to be a head missing. As for the stable-cleaning 
2 CONC scam for profit  for which a court case is still pending  no way! Still two Labors to go, laddie." Steam came out of HERACLES's ears but he stayed in control and headed off to find the Golden 
2 CONC Apples. No-one could tell him where they were, and he floundered around until he came across the sleeping Sea God NEREUS. Knowing of his wisdom, he seized him by the beard and twisted both advice and 
2 CONC information out of him... The plan involved using ATLAS, who was best friends with the Golden Apple nymphs. To avoid unnecessary delays, HERACLES climbed up the orchard wall and shot Ladon the dragon 
2 CONC with a HYDRA dart, leaving the coast clear for nymph negotiations. ATLAS was holding up the Celestial Globe of the Heavens at the time. So Herc offered to take over his burden whilst the deed was performed. 
2 CONC ATLAS could not believe his luck. It was such a weight off his shoulders. What a relief! ATLAS certainly took his time hobnobbing with the HESPERIDES. To the sweating HERACLES, he seemed to be 
2 CONC gone for years. Finally he sauntered back with three Golden Apples and a big grin. ATLAS was in no hurry to resume his supporting role. "I'll tell you what mate," he said, "hang on in there and I'll take 
2 CONC the apples back to Eurywhotsit for you. It's no trouble. I'll be back in a month or two." After Ten Labors, HERACLES had learnt to match wits with the best. And ATLAS was far from smart. "Sure thing, 
2 CONC bud. Thanks very much. Oh, before you go, I'm getting a bit of a headache. Can you take over for a sec while I put a bit of padding on my head..?" Was ATLAS that gullible? Yes he was, and found himself 
2 CONC holding up the Heavens once more. So HERACLES returned to Mycenae with the Golden Apples, which EURYSTHEUS then donated to ATHENA... who then returned them to the HESPERIDES where they'd come from 
2 CONC in the first place. HERACLES may have been heard to use bad language at this point. Final Episode: The Capture Of CERBERUS…  Entry last modified on 11 December 2004

1 NAME HIPPOLYTA
1 SEX F
1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE HIPPOLYTA: Daughter of War God ARES, Warrior Queen of the Amazons, and really hip. The Amazons were a race of fierce females who shunned men and went to war on their own terms. The first of the radical 
2 CONC feminists, they not only burned their bras but cut their entire breasts off. However, this was not so much a political statement as a recognition that it's very difficult to hurl a javelin when your 
2 CONC boob is in the way. The Amazons managed perfectly well with one breast each. Their left breasts were left intact for baby-raising purposes, and if you're wondering where the babies came from in this 
2 CONC all-female society, well, so are we. However, the Amazons invariably got what they wanted. It was only when manly heroes such as THESEUS or HERACLES blundered onto the scene that things went pear-shaped... 
2 CONC The Labors of HeraclesEpisode 9: The Girdle Of Hyppolyta After the manly battle for the MARES-OF-DIOMEDES, this Labor seemed a bit peculiar. A girly Girdle? What did EURYSTHEUS want with that? Was 
2 CONC he getting soft? Not if it belonged to the Queen of the Amazons. Use that sort of language and you were in for a stomping. The Amazons were descendants of ARES but without his softer side. And the 
2 CONC Girdle in question was a magic belt donated by ARES  a decidedly unfeminine fashion accessory. HERACLES honed up his hatchet skills on the way, having bumped into fellow adventurer THESEUS. With involvement 
2 CONC in various conflicts en-route, he arrived at Thermodon with a boat full of companions. HIPPOLYTA actually came to greet him and thought for a mere man he was not too wimpy. He might even make good 
2 CONC breeding material for daughters. So when he mentioned girdles, she offered him the Belt of ARES. Which was not quite what he was expecting. HERA, still out to get him, was furious, and turned up in 
2 CONC disguise. Spreading malicious rumors amongst the Amazons, she incited them to attack the ship and kill all the strangers. HERACLES assumed all this was treachery planned by HIPPOLYTA. So she got it 
2 CONC in the neck first. Herc took the Girdle and then had to decimate two more Amazon leaders before they desisted. The boat left in a hurry, taking HERACLES into many other adventures. He was in no particular 
2 CONC hurry to return to EURYSTHEUS. When he finally did, he had many souvenirs and trophies to distribute amongst the Gods to win friends and enhance his reputation. Incidentally, we don't know if EURYSTHEUS 
2 CONC actually tried on the Girdle. He gave it to his daughter. Perhaps, he felt, it didn't suit him. Next Episode: The Cattle Of GERYON…  Entry last modified on 12 February 2004

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE Also known as HIPPOLYTOS, HYPPOLYTE, HYPPOLYTA, HIPPOLYTTAHIPPOLYTUS: Son of THESEUS the Minotaur Slayer and his mistress ANTIOPE. He was not a happy lad and did not like life in the palace where he grew 
2 CONC up. When a trumped-up charge of attempting to rape his stepmother Phaedra reached his ears he fled in a chariot. THESEUS prayed to the Gods to stop him, and POSEIDON, being nearest as the chariot 
2 CONC was hurtling along a coastal road, sent a huge wave, which startled the horses into causing a crash with fatal results. For a time, anyway. When ARTEMIS, his patron Goddess, heard about it she was livid. 
2 CONC She demanded that her client be restored to life as he was innocent of any crime and POSEIDON had not been asked to destroy him anyway. She raised such a commotion that ASCLEPIUS rushed to the accident 
2 CONC spot with his first aid kit. A shot of Ambrosia had HIPPOLYTUS sitting up and twisting his broken neck until the pain went. This in turn upset the FATES, who had not been consulted on this emergency 
2 CONC raising of the dead. It meant taking in a lot of extra sewing and having to unpick lots of threads  and someone would have to pay. They threatened to go on strike unless someone was stitched up, 
2 CONC so ZEUS had to kill ASCLEPIUS with a thunderbolt to keep them happy. ARTEMIS took HIPPOLYTUS away declaring she would make a new man of him. Which she did by marrying him off to Egeria, one of the NYMPHS, 
2 CONC and changing his name to the Roman VIRBIUS. The FATES are still wondering about this, but the Ambrosia is never going to wear off and HIPPOLYTUS is now an ancient hippy sitting in the sun and enjoying 
2 CONC the simple life forever.  Entry last modified on 27 August 2006

1 NOTE japanese mythology
1 NOTE Also known as FIRE-FADE, HIKOHOHODEMIHOORI: Otherwise known as Fire Fade, he's a God of Hunting, a great-grandson of AMATERASU, and the younger brother of HODERI. One day they got bored and decided to 
2 CONC do a job swap. But when HOORI used HODERI's fishing tackle, the line snapped and he lost his brother's favorite magic fish hook. HODERI was not of a forgiving disposition, and it was nag, nag, nag all 
2 CONC the way home. "That was my favorite hook and I want it back. Don't stand there waving your arms  go and get it. Don't come home until you've found it  I'm not cooking for you. I didn't catch anything 
2 CONC with your stupid hunting ear anyway." Then he took to throwing stones if Fade came near their domain. HOORI donned a wet suit and tried diving about in the sea, but it was hopeless. "Why am I doing 
2 CONC this?" he asked himself, "am I a God or a sardine?" But all was not lost. He had been spotted by OTOHIME, the Sea Dragon's daughter, who thought "Oooh he's gorgeous". Wearing her most seductive swimwear, 
2 CONC she managed purely by chance to accidentally collide with his canoe. They hit it off at once. "Do you come here often?" she asked. "Only in the canoodling season," he replied. With such repartee how 
2 CONC could things go wrong? When he confided about the missing fish hook she beamed with delight. "You've come to the right place. My dad is the Ruler of the Sea and if you come home to tea with me I'll 
2 CONC butter him up and get that silly hook back for you." Now she knew she had him hooked. At first RYUJIN, Dragon King of the Sea, was not too pleased when his daughter brought home what he presumed to be 
2 CONC a fisherman. Being the protector of aquatic species he had 'No Fishing' and 'Fishermen will be Devoured' notices all over the place. HOORI assured him he hated fishing as much as RYUJIN did. '"I only 
2 CONC tried it once  I hated every minute of it and I won't ever do it again  and if it will help I'll say sorry to the poor brave fish that got stuck on the hook and kiss his mouth better." After that the 
2 CONC two of them got on like a dragon on fire. Three actually, as the daughter was planning wedding gongs. Everything was going so swimmingly she was in no hurry. Life was good in the palace and the wedding 
2 CONC did eventually take place. But there came a day when HOORI remembered the fish hook and his brother and became strangely homesick. By now his wife was expecting a child, so with RYUJIN's blessing 
2 CONC and a gift of two Tide Jewels  and the fish hook of course  he planned a triumphant return to reclaim his half of the HOORI and HODERI kingdom. Was HODERI happy to see him? Not a bit. "Where the bloody 
2 CONC hell have you been. Gallivanting around getting married  not even so much as a postcard in all these years. Oh, we're going to use the No Postal Service as an excuse are we? Too much trouble to put 
2 CONC a message in a bottle then. Anyway where's my hook? No, I don't want to meet her. She can shove off and have your baby. I don't care where. It's none of my business. There's plenty of empty sheds around. 
2 CONC They should be full of fish, but you lost my best hook didn't you? Anyway, I'm going fishing even if the hook is bent and you haven't bothered to straighten it out properly." HOORI scratched his head 
2 CONC and got on with the matter in hand  settling his wife. She refused the services of a midwife and did not want him to be present at the birth. She wanted to be entirely alone. HOORI was very unhappy 
2 CONC about this and was determined to keep an eye on her, so he peered through a crack when he heard a cry. He should have listened to her. At the first labor pang his wife changed into a monstrous dragon. 
2 CONC HOORI shrieked in fright and dismay, and she did the same, scuttling off swiftly into the sea leaving him holding the baby. She never did return but sent a sister in a nanny's uniform to care for the 
2 CONC child. "Serves you right," said his brother. This time the easy going HOORI had had enough of these jibes and decided to test the Tide Jewels. These are the equivalent of microchips for sea control. 
2 CONC Jewel one  Whooooosh! Tide out out out. HODERI was stranded in a boat with no sea underneath  no fish. Jewel two Whoooosh! Tide in with tidal wave, boat sunk and HODERI up to his neck in water. Unfortunately 
2 CONC he never learnt to swim. HOORI controls tide to creep mode, and does not stop until only HODERI's mouth is above water screaming and begging for mercy and promising to be ever-so nice from now 
2 CONC on. What happened to HOORI's son? Well he grew up and married his caring aunt TAMAYON-HINE and they in turn had a son called KAMU-YAMATO, who grew up to be the first Human Emperor of Japan.  Entry

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE Also known as HORAIHORAE: Three Goddesses of the Seasons and, later, of Natural and Moral Law. They were three very beautiful and talented daughters of ZEUS and THEMIS, despite bearing the almost unbearable 
2 CONC names of EUNOMIA, DIKE and EIRENE. At least this was an improvement on their earlier ghastly names of Thallo, Carpo and Auxo. Their numbers are often exaggerated as they got around a lot and some 
2 CONC scholars feel there must be almost a dozen. This is because they went partying a lot with the GRACES and could do chorus girl routines. On the other hand, their name means 'Hours' and there are twelve 
2 CONC hours in a day.  Amongst many other things, they look after the Gates of Heaven. When undesirables approach, they slide a cloud in front so no-one can get through or get hurt. So much nicer than a 
2 CONC board proclaiming 'Trespassers Will Be Thunderbolted'. The HORAE do lots of fruity and blossomy things, and also offer services such as babysitting for the Gods and feeding the horses. No-one has a word

2 CONC was grandson of the Han Dynasty Empress Gao. The spiritually-inclined prince joined them on their travels, and after a while managed to wheedle some wishes out of them. Just simple things like Immortality, 
2 CONC Omniscience and Omnipotence. As soon as he had partaken of the Elixir of Immortality, HUAI-NANZU's body shed its mortal nature. He became as light as a feather and found himself shooting up into

2 CONC only proper to introduce himself and pay his respects to the Gods. But in his excitement he dropped the bottle of Elixir, which went spinning back to Earth and landed in his very own courtyard. Arriving 
2 CONC in Heaven, HUAI-NANZU prepared to introduce himself to the great and majestic JADE-EMPEROR, who any minute now would turn in his direction and address him. He composed himself with infinitely respectful

2 CONC other "pass it this way" and "get into him sonny" and "that ball was never off-side" that they disturbed the Underworld beneath the field. VUCUB-CAQUIX, Lord of the Underworld, was very irate and sent 
2 CONC messengers summoning HUN-HUNAHPU and his brother to the Underworld Cup Final. Along the way there were many dangerous intelligence tests which, being more brawn than brain, they failed miserably. But 
2 CONC more humiliation was to come when the XIBALBA Team walked onto the field. Their star player VUCUB-CAQUIX bent the rules and cut off HUN-HUNAHPU's head. The referee didn't like to say anything or even

1 SEX F
1 NOTE finnish mythology
1 NOTE Also known as LUONNOTARILMATAR: Goddess of Air and Creator of the world via Cosmic Egg cookery. In the beginning there was only ILMATAR, the void and a great deal of wind. ILMATAR, tired of counting rainbows 
2 CONC and letting the wind play with her hair, began to long for a son. Her longing was so great that the East Wind itself took pity. She found herself buffeted and tossed by the wind's tempestuous 
2 CONC love-making until, exhausted, she could bear it no longer and collapsed. And there inside her was conceived VAINAMOINEN, the child of the wind. Unfortunately he didn't seem inclined to make an appearance, 
2 CONC and after seven centuries or so she began to give up hope of seeing him. Then one day she noticed a Celestial Duck flying overhead. (Okay, it wasn't a duck, it was an eagle. Have you never heard 
2 CONC of poetic licence?) The poor bird was desperately pregnant and looking for somewhere to land. So ILMATAR helpfully raised her knee and the bird came swooping down. Half a dozen Cosmic Eggs were laid, 
2 CONC followed by an egg made of iron. The bird then gathered them all up, sat upon them and went to sleep... And now ILMATAR was faced with a problem familiar to anyone with a household pet. How do you move 
2 CONC without waking them up? Her leg was aching, her knee was hotter than an incubator and she desperately wanted to go to the bathroom. Slowly, carefully, she began to stretch out her leg.. and slowly, 
2 CONC inevitably, the seven eggs rolled off and fell majestically into the raging sea. Now, Cosmic Eggs are delicate things, and no sooner had they touched the water than the shells cracked and a vast Cosmic 
2 CONC Omelette was formed upon the waves. ILMATAR watched in amazement as the churning mixture solidified into Heaven and Earth. One yolk slipped into the sky to form PAIVATAR, the Sun, while the egg white 
2 CONC became KUU, the glistening Moon. Stars were made from pieces of speckled eggshell, and thus the world was formed. You may be wondering what happened to the iron egg. Well, the black yolk became a thundercloud. 
2 CONC (That egg didn't have a white as you can't have a black white.) ILMATAR was delighted with events, and busied herself shaping the lands and adding finnishing touches. And then she felt a stirring 
2 CONC inside her. VAINAMOINEN had woken up after so many years and was eager to see the new world. He had quite a struggle to get out as no-one seemed very keen to help him, but he managed in the end 
2 CONC and emerged, a bouncing bonny old man. We're not sure what happened to ILMATAR after that. Is she still tending to creation? What happened to the Celestial Duck? You are welcome to her feast day celebrations 
2 CONC on 26th of August  and then perhaps you can let us know what the scrambled egg situation is.  Entry last modified on 09 March 2004

1 NOTE mesopotamian mythology
1 NOTE Also known as INANA, INNANA, INNINAINANNA: Goddess of Words, Language, Syntax and Meaning. It's all writing, innit? Having peeked at the Tablets of Destiny (ME), she is an expert at persuasive NAM-SHUBbery. 
2 CONC The daughter of ANU (or possibly his son ENLIL), she has much in common with ISHTAR. She married a shepherd type Deity called DUMUZI and built him a city to rule called Uruk. She also has a sister 
2 CONC (possibly a twin) called ERESHKIGAL who was ruler of the Underworld. One day INANNA said to her maid Ninshubar 'Look after things for a day or two  I'm going Down Under to see how sis is getting on 
2 CONC  we haven't seen each other for yonks.' Well, it was quite a lark. There were seven gates, and before she went through each one she had to do a bit of strip tease. This was a strip search with a difference. 
2 CONC By the time she got to the throne room she was starkers. Unabashed, as she was not the bashful type INANNA cried 'Wheee  ain't we got fun! Wow  give us a kiss, move over and lemmee have a go 
2 CONC on that fab throne! The ministers and judges of the dead in attendance on ERESHKIGAL were appalled and gave INANNA the sort of looks that could kill. So INANNA dropped dead. They hung the corpse on a 
2 CONC butcher's hook. ERESHKIGAL did not seem very concerned. Twinning had never been her thing. Ninshubar was the one who became concerned when her mistress did not return. She prayed to the Gods but there 
2 CONC was much shaking of heads and shuffling from above and only ENKI came to her aid. He created two zombie-like beings and gave them a lunch box containing immortality snacks. Having no hearts or anything 
2 CONC to prove they were alive they went through the seven gates without let or hindrance. In the Throne room they just took INANNA off the hook and restored her to life. The judges looks were of no use. 
2 CONC Somewhat subdued by now INANNA asked her sister if she could leave now. 'Well, I can let you off the hook for the time being' said ERESHKIGAL,' but you must send me a replacement, or you will have to 
2 CONC come back.'Doing a reverse strip on the way out, INANNA shot back to Uruk a top speed to find DUMUZI having the time of his life and sleeping with GESHTINANNA the Goddess of Wine, another sister of hers. 
2 CONC She packed both of them off the Underworld and they each have to do a six-month stint  Duz in summer, Gesh in winter. You would think all this sort of thing would have slowed INANNA down, but not 
2 CONC a bit. She was always a headstrong girl and having heard of the "ME", The Tablets of Destiny and Fundamental Powers of the Universe had been left for safekeeping with ENKI, She thought 'ME, ME, ME! They're 
2 CONC going to be mine!' She paid a visit to ENKI who now had a slight drink problem and by using flattery, her considerable sexual charm and getting him well and truly sozzled, she persuaded him to 
2 CONC let her have a peek at one of the famous tablets. Then another one. And then could she hold one? By the end of the evening she not only held them, she loaded them onto her barge and pushed off rapidly 
2 CONC for Uruk. When ENKI woke up with a hangover and found he had given the tablets away, he was not a happy God. He sent his minions in pursuit, but she outwitted them all, proclaiming that ENKI had given 
2 CONC them of His Own Free Will. His being drunk at the time was not her problem  he should join Alcoholics Anonymous. (This of course was not really feasible because everyone knew who ENKI was.) And that 
2 CONC was that.  Entry last modified on 22 May 2005

2 CONC With cunning ingenuity she managed to reassemble the body for burial, and couldn't resist one last rite which was more fertility than funeral. In consequence, she became pregnant with glorious HORUS, 
2 CONC and had to go into hiding before bad brother SET found out. Luckily her mothering skills paid off and HORUS grew into a SETbeating superhero who became the first ruler of a peaceful united Egypt. 
2 CONC ISIS settled down to enjoy royal life, attending garden parties and state functions in her role as King's Mother. She now has a fetching line in headgear featuring cow horns and sun disc. We've seen 
2 CONC this before somewhere. Royal Ascot perhaps. ISIS was one of the few Egyptian Gods the Greeks took a fancy to, and she even went through to the Romans. There was a temple built to her at Pompeii. The 
2 CONC cult became very popular and her consort OSIRIS was probably the foundation of the Greek/Egyptian Hybrid-God SERAPIS. During the Cleopatra/Anthony affair, Cleo saw herself as the personification of ISIS. 
2 CONC With her departure, the Roman Senate did its best to demolish her Egyptian shrines, but you can't keep a good Goddess down. By the time of Julius Caesar the cult was thriving and had its own festivals. 
2 CONC All through this, ISIS shook her sistrum  which she retained despite her classical look statue makeover. With the Christians she happily became identified as the Virgin MARY. The Armenian liturgy 
2 CONC even retained the rattling sistrum sound. Penitents crawling on a symbolic search for Christ were only replacing the earlier devotees on the symbolic search for OSIRIS.  Entry last modified on 28 August

2 CONC and Lord of the Imperial Court. Starting at the bottom by creating the Universe, he helped YUAN-SHI-TIAN-ZONG bring order to the cosmos. Working his way to the top, he spent a billion aeons contemplating 
2 CONC his Holy Navel before finally achieving a state of the most amazingly perfect Godliness. Having achieved Illumination and Omnipotence, he became supreme Heavenly Ruler, and Emperor of the Universe. 
2 CONC Even the human ruler of China was simply a manifestation of the JADE-EMPEROR. Earthly Emperors were given leave to rule by the MANDATE-OF-HEAVEN, provided they checked in every so often via a Jade PI-DISC. 
2 CONC His word is law and he rules all Heaven and Earth with a vast company of civil servants and bureaucrats at his beck and call. The CHENG-HUANG and TU-DI look after Earthly paperwork, and every 
2 CONC year the ZAO-JUN file a report on your conduct for him to assess. If that's not impressive enough, the JADE-EMPEROR found further fame when DAOism and Buddhism came into play and engulfed him in the utmost 
2 CONC holiness. Not to mention the most amazingly complicated symbolism. His list of official titles expanded in all directions. 'Most Venerable Jade Emperor Of The Heavenly Golden Palace'... 'Supremely 
2 CONC High Emperor Of The Heavens, Holder Of Talismans, Container Of Perfection and Embodiment Of Dao'... and finally, 'Most Venerable And Highest Jade Emperor Of All-Embracing Sublime Spontaneous Existence 
2 CONC Of The Heavenly Golden Palace'. We think that just about covers everything. The only other deity to compare is the magnificent MONKEY, who arrogantly challenged his rule, caused havoc in Heaven and 
2 CONC was finally persuaded to behave by being given a meaningless but magnificent-sounding official title. That's politics for you. In fact, the JADE-EMPEROR is a master of winning without really doing anything.

1 NAME JEHOVAH
1 SEX M
1 NOTE middle-eastern mythology
1 NOTE Also known as THEOS, KURIOS, TRINITY, YEHOVAH, GEORGEJEHOVAH: The monotheistic Lord GOD Almighty of Christianity, a three-in-one deity comprising the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In one small 
2 CONC corner of the world, YAHWEH, the God of Judaism, was worshipped with the utmost devotion. He had obliterated his nearest rivals, but he was a big fish in an ever-shrinking pond. Then JESUS came along 
2 CONC in a burst of publicity offering eternal life and free gifts  and a controversial twist. According to JESUS, YAHWEH was the GOD of all nations, not just the Jews. It didn't matter what food you ate or 
2 CONC how you trimmed your beard. What mattered was love, belief and devotion. This came as a surprise to most of YAHWEH's worshippers, who were only doing what he'd told them to do all along. But many were 
2 CONC convinced. Followers of JESUS were instructed to spread the word, so Christians stampeded all over the world to deliver their revelation. In the chaos that followed, Christians, Jews, Romans and Greeks 
2 CONC tussled and fought to defend their beliefs. It was like a gigantic punch-up, a verbal war in which the most effective weapon was generally an overactive tongue and deaf ears. The first Christians 
2 CONC were bursting with enthusiasm, but being mostly ex-fishermen and AWOL tax collectors, they had little grasp of theological niceties. To their audience, they sounded like a bunch of blasphemers  and were 
2 CONC lynched on a daily basis. But along came PAUL. He was a Jewish troubleshooter who'd been happily persecuting Christians until JESUS appeared to him in a flash of light and told him to leave off. Paul 
2 CONC was educated, literate, and had a real genius for theological mechanics. He not only saw the light, he understood it, fine-tuned it, and preached it. Paul was single-handedly responsible for converting 
2 CONC the subtleties of JESUS's somewhat evasive approach into a robust and fully-fledged new religion for the masses. It went like this: Because ADAM, the father of mankind, had sinned, all humans were 
2 CONC sinners  and deserved death. In the past, YAHWEH had demanded the blood of animals to atone for mankind's sinful existence. But now he'd sent his Son to die in mankind's place  and this sacrifice was 
2 CONC great enough to wipe the slate clean for ever. The resurrection of JESUS showed that God was willing to forgive and forget. But this idea only made sense if JESUS was actually a God. (Who cares if 
2 CONC a mere man is sacrificed? People have been slaughtering each other for millennia.) As everyone agreed rather strongly that there was only one GOD, a degree of theological tinkering was called for. Result: 
2 CONC a Holy Makeover in which YAHWEH was transformed into the concept of JEHOVAH  a Trinity package deal of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Now we have to admit that we've taken a slight liberty. The name 
2 CONC 'Jehovah' is a late invention which won't be found in any Testament. It's a slightly misguided mix of vowels and consonants from the original Holy Names Yhwh and Adonai  created so that people wouldn't 
2 CONC utter the actual name (see YHWH). This was fine in Hebrew but went very badly in translation. But as it's very popular among Christians, we've used the name 'Jehovah' to distinguish the Christian 
2 CONC version of GOD from the Jewish one. Okay? In Christianity, YAHWEH is the Jealous Father and Lawgiver, JESUS is the Loving Son and Judge, and the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit. Each personality is distinct 
2 CONC and separate, yet JEHOVAH is also an indivisible whole. Analogies with other three-in-one concepts such as water/ice/steam or mind/body/spirit don't really clarify much, and this Trinity business 
2 CONC is regarded by the Church as the Ultimate Mystery. Which neatly  but understandably  sidesteps the issue completely. Three-in-One Humans?Now here's a question: If JEHOVAH created man in his own image, 
2 CONC why don't humans have three-in-one personalities? Answer: They do. Godchecker can reveal that the human brain consists of three separate but complementary parts: the R-Complex (ritualistic behavior), 
2 CONC the Limbic System (emotional response) and the Neocortex (thought and language). We all possess a 'Triune Brain'. This 'Law, Love and Language' model can be equated with the Trinity to such precision, 
2 CONC we're staggered the Christian Church doesn't preach about it from the rooftops. Perhaps they don't like what it implies about  the Father: obsessive, aggressive, ritualistic and very keen on blood. 
2 CONC On the other hand, it sheds much light on the Holy Spirit, who brings intellectual inspiration and also the gift of speaking in tongues. But perhaps it's embarrassing for the Church to be proved right 
2 CONC by cold hard Science. And equally embarrassing for Science to be pre-empted by religion. With such a mind-twisting concept at the heart of Christianity, it's not surprising that people found it hard 
2 CONC to accept. Schisms and sects popped up all over the place. Heretics lurked on every corner. As the centuries passed, there were enough alternative versions of JEHOVAH to populate a telephone directory. 
2 CONC Such confusion was bad for business. Especially since the Roman Emperor Constantine was in the market for an official religion to unify his people. He was a big fan of JEHOVAH but not of chaos. So 
2 CONC in 325 AD the highest-ranking bishops assembled the famous Council of Nicea to define once and for all what they were supposed to believe in. This resulted in the Nicean Creed  and made Christianity 
2 CONC the first and only religion ever to be decided by vote. Democracy had given a big thumbs-up to JEHOVAH, and he was very willing to return the favor. The Church and the State have been best buddies ever 
2 CONC since. (Particularly in Vatican City, where the Church is the State.) This alliance gave Christianity a huge boost, particularly when it came to obliterating other religions via invasion, persecution 
2 CONC or  if all else failed  war. Christianity was a huge success. At least, for the Christians. Other cultures had a tendency to shrivel up and die when JEHOVAH arrived at the door. Like a sponge, Christianity 
2 CONC absorbed pagan religions and stole all the best bits. For example, Easter (Saxon) and Christmas (Germanic and/or Roman). Local Gods were demoted to the level of Saints, Angels or  in really difficult 
2 CONC cases  Demons. (See CROM-CRUAICH, SHEELA-NA-GIG, PAN, OSTARA...) How times have changed since the bad old days of unpronounceable YHWH and the Public Relations disasters of MOSES. Thanks to the 
2 CONC JESUS factor, JEHOVAH is accessible, friendly, and suitable for all members of the family. A bit like a Disney movie really.  Entry last modified on 27 August 2006

1 NAME JESUS
1 SEX M
1 NOTE middle-eastern mythology
1 NOTE Also known as CHRIST, JESUS-CHRIST, JOSHUA, MESSIAH, SON-OF-MAN, YESHUA, YAHSHUA, Y'SHUAJESUS: The Son of GOD, the Second Person in the Trinity of JEHOVAH, and the source of Christian belief. The strange 
2 CONC thing about JESUS is that he didn't exist. If you had seen him in Nazareth and shouted 'Hey Jesus!', he would have taken no notice  because he was actually named Joshua. Blame this misunderstanding 
2 CONC on the translation from Hebrew to Greek several years after the main event. The earthly life of JESUS was full of controversy  even before he was born. An Angel of the Lord visited MARY, the fiance 
2 CONC of a builder named Joseph, and told her to expect a happy event. Sure enough, she conceived a miraculous baby  with no human intervention. Fortunately the Angel also visited Joseph, or this would have 
2 CONC taken some explaining: Mary: "Er, Joe... I'm sorry love but I'm pregnant. Yes I know we haven't done anything, but God came to me while you were at the Carpenters Convention." Joseph: "Are you sure it 
2 CONC was God?" Mary: "Sure I am. I recognised his Holy Light. And he said not to worry; I'm still a virgin." Joseph: "Okay. But if it happens again, tell him you've got a headache." Joseph stood by her, 
2 CONC but in that place and time, an unmarried pregnant virgin was a scandal waiting to happen. Perhaps it's no coincidence that mere months later Mary and Joseph left town. They went to Bethlehem, apparently 
2 CONC to register for a census. But this census may or may not have happened, depending on which scholar you believe. The matter is complicated by the uncertainty over exact dates and the fact there were 
2 CONC two Herods ruling in quick succession. But scholarly opinion tends to veer off in all directions, so we're inclined to take the Gospel accounts at face value and see where that takes us. In this case, 
2 CONC the tiny town of Bethlehem, birthplace of YAHWEH's favorite King David in ancient times  and, according to popular belief, birthplace of his successor the Messiah. The inn was full, so JESUS was born 
2 CONC in the vicinity of a stable. Presumably this was part of the divine plan and not due to having forgotten to book a room in advance. Christmas came early that year  possibly some time in October. There 
2 CONC was a shiny star (or comet, or planetary conjunction), astrologers with pressies, a flock of shepherds, and all sorts of commotion. But no early night for Mary; no midwife, hot water or towels. Just 
2 CONC a mangy old manger. Still, the pressies were okay. The fragrant perfume covered up the barnyard smells, and gold is gold. It must have been a terrible shock for JESUS when he found out God was his real 
2 CONC father. How can one live up to such expectations? Goodness knows he tried, even though Daddy never came near enough to give him a hug or take him out to the park. It must have put the family under 
2 CONC a lot of strain when old ladies tickled his chin and said: "Oooh, he looks just like his dad." By all accounts (most of them apocryphal), JESUS was a precocious lad, turning water into milk and explaining 
2 CONC Scripture to bemused Rabbis. But almost nothing is known of his early years, and JESUS the acne-ridden confused teenager is lost to history. Instead we next catch up with him as he starts his ministry, 
2 CONC aged thirty-something. Following a short prelude in which JESUS and popular preacher John the Baptist exchanged the spiritual equivalent of a Masonic handshake, he appears to have received a holy 
2 CONC epiphany  and vanished into the desert for forty days to take stock. A self-imposed starvation diet must have put him in a very reflective frame of mind. At the end of his fasting, SATAN took him 
2 CONC for a test drive which he passed with flying colors. On his return, JESUS began to preach in synagogues and public places. His message: the Kingdom of Heaven was near at hand and woe betide anyone who 
2 CONC did not repent of their sin. His words were invariably contentious, cutting through religious waffle and striking to the heart of the matter. (People who imagine JESUS to be a wimpy long-haired peacenik 
2 CONC should go read his words again; he was deliberately provocative.) He soon became famous, if not infamous, for his outspoken attacks on the status quo. And, like a Judaic combination of Gandhi, Lennon 
2 CONC and Geldof, he was cheered by the people while the establishment seethed. By offering a sympathetic non-judgmental counselling service, free medical treatment, miraculous entertainment, and a highly 
2 CONC popular course in moral philosophy, JESUS managed to upset almost everyone who wasn't poor or needy. But the Jewish authorities couldn't touch him. Whenever they tried to trap him in a violation of 
2 CONC Scripture, JESUS ran verbal rings around them. Could this really be the Messiah? The Jewish leaders were starting to look very foolish indeed. To make matters worse, JESUS had a terrible habit of performing 
2 CONC miracles. Walking on water was one thing, but changing water into wine could not have increased his popularity with vineyard owners. And there was that incident when the demons he'd exorcised 
2 CONC from afflicted humans entered into in a herd of swine  which hurled themselves over a cliff squealing in terror. This was a blow from which the Gadarene pork industry never recovered. No-one has dared 
2 CONC to touch a sausage since. Finally the Powers That Be could stand it no longer and plots were hatched. JESUS is credited with predicting his betrayal, but it must have been pretty obvious that something 
2 CONC was in the air. He was not stupid, and his finger was on the pulse of the nation. He knew what was in store for him. But instead of fighting against his fate, he accepted it. And that is probably the 
2 CONC most significant thing he ever did. Would Christianity be around today if JESUS had resisted arrest and done a runner? Would the Bible have survived to become the world's most popular book (non-fiction 
2 CONC category) if JESUS had begged for mercy and promised to keep his beatitudes to himself in future? Of course not. And so he was crucified  a very nasty death indeed. His last agonized words were: 
2 CONC "Father, why have you forsaken me?" Which we can't help feeling is a very good question. For God to devise the nastiest and cruellest death for his only son and just let it happen seems beyond belief. 
2 CONC But that takes us into the realm of Theology, and you'll need to consult our entry on JEHOVAH for something approaching an explanation. Meanwhile, the disciples he'd chosen turned out to be a motley 
2 CONC crew of misfits and cowards. JUDAS-ISCARIOT betrayed him, PETER denied he had ever seen him, and the rest  apart from JOHN  stayed well out of the way during his crucifixion. They'd never really understood 
2 CONC half of what their master said, and now they were stunned, shocked and terrified. It was left to a group of women to go near the tomb afterwards to pay respects and perform their funeral duties. 
2 CONC But the tomb was empty... We've come across so many 'rational' explanations for the empty tomb that it might be more rational to believe JESUS was abducted by space aliens. We've examined every possible 
2 CONC theory  scientific, religious, historical, archeological, supernatural  and we've decided to believe that all of them are true. After all, with JEHOVAH all things are possible. But you are at liberty 
2 CONC to form your own opinion. So we humbly suggest you read the New Testament for yourself  and then get Googling for God.  Entry last modified on 28 August 2006

2 CONC could be applied to any deity who fancied a boost. Particularly UKKO. Over time, the word JUMALA came to be identifed with the Christian God JEHOVAH, who more-or-less took over the position of Top Finnish

2 CONC an amazing assortment of items from a lotus flower to a dragon's head. We haven't a clue what her mission is, although she is wise and benevolent. Sailors sought her protection, so perhaps she runs

1 NAME JUPITER
1 SEX M
1 NOTE roman mythology
1 NOTE Also known as JOVE, OPTIMUS-MAXIMUS, JUPITER-VICTOR, DIES-PATERJUPITER: Supreme Top God of the Roman Pantheon, Ruler of Heaven and Earth and the Father of the Gods. Like most of the really big Roman Gods, 
2 CONC JUPITER started out as a primeval nature deity. A Sky God, he was in charge of the fundamental forces of nature and ruled the weather with an iron grip and a big stick. When Greek culture began to 
2 CONC influence Roman thought, JUPITER took on the attributes of ZEUS  with added Latin. With his forceful personality, he became King of the Gods and the special protector of Rome. The Romans were always 
2 CONC keen to get the Gods on their side and JUPITER was definitely a force to be reckoned with  especially with his thunderbolt-hurling propensities. They awarded him many flattering titles and put him in 
2 CONC charge of their entire legal and political system. Worshipped as Optimus Maximus, the all-powerful good guy, JUPITER kept order and brought prosperity to the nation. As Jupiter Victor he led the Roman 
2 CONC army to victory in wars and conquests time and time again. In fact he was probably the Roman Empire's greatest asset after plumbing. Of course it all went terribly wrong in the end and the Empire fell. 
2 CONC Perhaps JUPITER was offended by the deification of human emperors, particularly the later ones who were a bit rubbishy. Or maybe the new-fangled Christianity craze was the final insult. Either way, 
2 CONC JUPITER withdrew his support and sloped off, leaving the Romans to fend for themselves. Where is he now? Enjoying a well-earned grouchy retirement? Still hurling thunderbolts? Communing with the eagles? 
2 CONC All sightings gratefully received. You can't miss him, he has a Godly beard, holds a thunderbolt and is stark naked.  Entry last modified on 08 October 2006

1 NAME KALEVALA
1 NOTE finnish mythology
1 NOTE KALEVALA: This is the epic 'Land of Heroes' poem that so much of Finnish Mythology is based upon. Where did it originate? Mostly with one man  a scholar called Elias Lonnrot who, during a period of national 
2 CONC fervour and identity promotion, rushed around seeking and recording poems, ballads, folk takes and all the material he could gather at many gatherings without the benefit of a tape recorder. Elias 
2 CONC took it upon himself to finalise it in verse as a grand gripping saga to rival Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. Only it is in Finnish so no doubt much gets lost in translation. Even so, Longfellow nicked 
2 CONC the rhyming style for 'Hiawatha'. And Sibelius used it as a basis for many of his compositions. The KALEVALA did not get published until 1835, with 12,000 verses, but by 1849 a revised version had grown 
2 CONC to 22,800 verses. It has been going strong ever since, although Elias himself died in 1884. You can even download a translation from the net if you have enough paper and patience.  The KALEVALA is 
2 CONC taken by many as 'The Be-All and End-All' of Finnish Mythology, but this is not quite the case. There was a lot going on before 1835, by which time Christianity was well established. Shaman's drums 
2 CONC were being destroyed and former forms of worship eradicated.  But much lingers on in the more remote area now known as Lapland, where the Saami (or Samer) reside. The Gods still keep a low but powerful

1 NOTE Also known as CHEPRI, KHEPER, KHEPERA, KEHPERIKHEPRI: God of Renewal and Rebirth. If you believe the world is a Great Ball of Dung, KHEPRI is the one for you  he's the Sacred Egyptian Dung Beetle. Every 
2 CONC morning, come rain or shine, he pushes his dungball up the hill to symbolise RA, the rising sun. In the evening he passes the ball to ATUM. We hope they wash their hands afterwards.Because baby scarab 
2 CONC beetles are hatched from dung, the Egyptians thought there must be something very potent in the stuff. So KHEPRI became the prestigious God of Rebirth, and not, as you might have thought, the God

1 NOTE egyptian mythology
1 NOTE Also known as CHNUM, CHNOUMIS, CHNUPHIS, CHNEMU, KEMU, KHNEMU, KNOUPHIS, KNUMKHNUM: Ram-headed God of Creative Pottery. He creates everybody's bodies on his potter's wheel, shaping the clay as it turns 
2 CONC round and around. If you ever get dizzy spells, that's probably why. His wife is the froggy Goddess of Childbirth HEKET. When a clay baby is finished, they sneak it into the mother's womb and nature 
2 CONC takes its course. Which shows that the ancient Egyptians weren't silly enough to believe all that nonsense about storks and cabbage patches. Tracking down the variations of his name has caused us no

2 CONC young thing who loves intellectual games and quizzes. When he isn't holed up with THOTH playing Trivial Pursuit, he cures the sick by expelling demons. Long ago, his fame spread far and wide and 
2 CONC he was called to some distant domain called Bekhten to cast out a demon inside a princess. They were so pleased with the results they tried to keep him for themselves. After a time KHONSU got homesick. 
2 CONC He recalled the demon and made an arrangement that the demon would leave the domain forever if a small sacrifice was made. This was done and eventually KHONSU managed to slip back to Egypt leaving a

1 NAME KHUZWANE
1 SEX M
1 NOTE african mythology
1 NOTE KHUZWANE: Creator God of the Transvaal. He's a very remote God, but he did at least leave some trace of himself behind. When the world was young and freshly-made, all the rocks and stones were soft and 
2 CONC squidgy. Just like clay. So KHUZWANE used this malleable muddy stuff to make the first humans. And the landscape around the Limpopo River bears the imprint of KHUZWANE's bare feet as he walked about 
2 CONC making model citizens. These Godly footprints have given certain places a sacred aspect which persists to this day. Once a year, in a semi-secret ceremony, local beer is poured into them. We can barely 
2 CONC guess the reasons for this practice, but we trust that good beer is not going to waste. Meanwhile, Lake Fundudzi is a very special place to the VahVenda people. They believe it to be KHUZWANE's private 
2 CONC swimming pool. Apparently he sometimes returns to Earth for a quick dip. Consequently, no-one is allowed to visit the Lake without permission. It might be advisable to take some beer as well. By 
2 CONC all accounts, Lake Fundudzi  Africa's only natural freshwater lake  is a mysterious place. For a start, it's home to a giant fertility snake and a beer-guzzling white crocodile. (These may even be Gods, 
2 CONC but we suspect not.) Most importantly, it's a VahVenda burial ground. There's an underwater village populated by spirits of the dead  and sometimes in the dead of night you can hear them singing their 
2 CONC underwater laments. No wonder the Lake is full of tribal taboos. No fishing! No swimming! And if you do get permission to visit, prepare to be humbled; first-time visitors have to bend down and peer 
2 CONC at the waters from between their legs. We hope the Queen gets to visit someday. The Tshiavha clan of the VhaVenda are guardians of the Lake, and their methods have managed to keep it pristine and pure 
2 CONC for centuries. This has become increasingly difficult in modern times, but long may they continue. When they say No Fishing, they mean it!  Entry last modified on 24 August 2005

2 CONC fashion accessory. They looked really cool and also gave him holy power, magnificence and top universal status. It was like having a Babylonian iPod. Unfortunately for him, the boost he received from 
2 CONC wearing the ME Tablets as a breastplate made a lot of people jealous. Particularly since they'd been stolen in the first place. KINGU was killed by ANU, and his body recycled to form universal bonus tracks

2 CONC who drained his blood, mixed it with honey and fermented it into a highly potent mead. This became known as Kvas, the Mead of Inspiration, a fiery brew the color of beetroot. Drinking it was a highly 
2 CONC enlightening experience. The entire supply of Kvas was then taken from the dwarves by the giant SUTTUNG in payment for a family feud, and hidden in the mountains with his sister GUNNLOD guarding it. 
2 CONC ODIN, who desperately wanted a taste of the infamous brew, used every subterfuge in his extensive repertoire to gain access. Eventually he appeared in front of the buxom barmaid GUNNLOD and begged for 
2 CONC three tiny sips. After a little friendly persuasion, she granted his request and watched in horror as he drained all three jars to the dregs. He then changed himself into an eagle and flew off, somewhat 
2 CONC unsteadily. This looked like the end of the Mead of Inspiration, until it was discovered that fermented beetroot juice produced much the same effect. We have a theory that the blood of KVASIR was 
2 CONC such a beautiful Godly red that the left-over dregs were thrown onto a field of beetroots to inspire growth. This is so far unsubstantiated, but you have to start somewhere and stranger things have happened. 
2 CONC Soon everyone was making Mead of Inspiration. So the KVASIR Beetroot Brewery is more than likely the cause for the proliferation of drunken poets which permeate society in every century. It also 
2 CONC happens that once upon a time the Chief Godchecker, in a previous spiritual existence, made some Beetroot Wine. It was indeed a godly red in the first stages, but as fermentation ceased, the colour 
2 CONC slowly faded to a pale tawny rust, or washed-out bloodstain. It was left to mature for a year or two, when upon sampling it did indeed prove to be very inspirational...  Entry last modified on 12 June

2 CONC in Henan Province in the year 604 B.C.  having been conceived by a shooting star and carried in his mother's womb for 83 years before being born as an old man with flowing white beard. You can't get 
2 CONC more historically genuine than that. Legend tells that LAO-ZI was employed as a keeper of government records. Unfortunately he didn't keep his own record very well, and virtually nothing is known of 
2 CONC him. Even his name is a nom-de-plume, meaning simply 'old master'. But in the interests of biography, we can picture him sitting at a desk surrounded by boring parchments. His mind begins to wander and 
2 CONC suddenly the Secret of the Universe is revealed to him. (A similar thing happened to Einstein while he was working at the Swiss Patent Office, but that's another story.) Things get more interesting 
2 CONC when, at the end of his life, LAO-ZI decided to emigrate to Tibet for a little peace and quiet. He climbed aboard a water buffalo and got as far as the western gate of the city, where he stopped for 
2 CONC a cup of tea with the gatekeeper. According to legend, the gatekeeper was so stunned at LAO-ZI's wisdom that he begged him to jot down a few revelations for posterity. LAO-ZI grabbed a brush and dashed 
2 CONC off a few ultimate truths before heading on his way. He was never seen again (at least on Earth), but left behind the Dao De Jing (Tao Te Ching) for future generations to ponder over. This slim volume 
2 CONC consists of a few simple, but deeply meaningful, poems in which DAO ('The Way') is expounded. If you can't understand the delicate nuances of his writing, there's an entire industry of authors, websites 
2 CONC and organisations out there who will be more than happy to explain it to you. As for the reclusive LAO-ZI, he ended up in Heaven. Now deified as one of the SAN-QING under the name LAO-JUN, he advises 
2 CONC the JADE-EMPEROR on do-nothing policy and spends long aeons refining doctrine. He also makes immortality pills for a hobby. Visits are strictly by appointment only.  Entry last modified on 15 April

2 CONC a banished heir to the throne of Sparta, and when the eggs arrived two of the yolks were his: CASTOR and Clytemnestra. The other two, POLLUX and HELEN, were ZEUSlings. There is as usual a subplot to

2 CONC well and truly goosed when ZEUS chose to go as a Gander. Naturally there was a resultant egg, and as a Goddess of Retribution NEMESIS is said by some to have slipped her egg into LEDA's hatchery  and 
2 CONC this is the one that contained POLLUX and HELEN. Followers of NEMESIS became very confused and some assumed any big white bird with feathers laying eggs must be their beloved Goddess and who the hell

2 CONC to stay, where he set up his 'Lu'. Which was a place of meditation not dissimilar to the modern variety.  LI-BABAI, who suffered from a strange skin condition, had a rich sponsor who wished to learn 
2 CONC the immortality secrets from him. "My boils must be licked away first," says Li. "I'll set the servants on it,"  says Mr Moneybags. "No, you must do it yourself," demands Li. After it hadn't worked, 
2 CONC LI-BABAI opted to be bathed in wine from a million bottles. This really does work, but the wine must be full-bodied red with a rich plummy flavor. And then he ascended to Heaven, leaving behind his 
2 CONC Earthly remains.  Entry last modified on 15 April 2004

1 NOTE chinese mythology
1 NOTE Also known as LI-NE-ZHA, LI-NOZHA, LI-NO-ZHA, LI-NO-CHALI-NEZHA: Trickster God Boy of Childish Pranks and Tantrums. Even if you are well-versed in Godly ways, it's just possible his story could stretch 
2 CONC your credulity. Formerly a monstrous Immortal with three heads, eight arms and nine eyes, LI-NEZHA was sent down to Earth by the JADE-EMPEROR to subdue a plague of demons. Smuggled in by a fellow immortal, 
2 CONC he turned up in the womb of Emperor LI-JING's wife and would have been killed at birth if he hadn't made certain Auspicious Signs and flashed a magic bracelet at them. They called him Third Prince. 
2 CONC Soon he was a strapping six-year-old lad, 6 ft tall and with pants of fire. Literally. One day, while he was paddling in the sea, he set it alight. Puzzled by the mysterious flames, AO-KUANG, the 
2 CONC Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, sent his princely son AO-PING to investigate. But in a playful mood of boyish high spirits, LI-NEZHA killed him. Oops. The enraged King zoomed from his Underwater Palace 
2 CONC seeking revenge, but was defeated himself in a most humiliating manner. The other DRAGON-KINGS, pausing only to squabble over the empty throne, got their own back by bursting into the Emperor's home 
2 CONC and kidnapping both LI-JING and his wife. This was a delicate situation requiring the utmost diplomacy and tact. So an abashed LI-NEZHA sulkily committed suicide and his parents were released. But 
2 CONC the next morning a rolling ball of flesh turned up at the palace. LI-JING sliced it open and zoom! there was LI-NEZHA again. His dad was very angry at all these goings-on, and tried to cut him down to 
2 CONC size. Father and son battled furiously, and it looked like the end for LI-JING. But the JADE-EMPEROR, who couldn't help feeling that his original plan had gone somewhat awry, intervened and made peace 
2 CONC between them. Father and son joined forces and thus begain their heroic career of demon-slaying. Many years later, when LI-NEZHA was back in Heaven enjoying the rewards of his labors, mortals back on 
2 CONC Earth began to worship him as a God of Lotteries and Gambling. Of all the Chinese Gods, he's probably the only one mischievous enough to reveal the winning numbers.  Entry last modified on 15 April

2 CONC LI-TIEGUAI travelled far and wide. Not caring for the public transport of the time, he liked to float whither he wished minus body. One day, his spirit paid a visit to LAO-ZI and learned the secrets of 
2 CONC Immortality. He arrived back to find his body had been cremated a little prematurely and was now a heap of ashes. In this situation you need to find a replacement body very rapidly indeed, or your chances 
2 CONC of getting into Heaven are zilch. The best LI-TIEGUAI could find on the spur of the moment was a dead beggar in a ditch. Worse still, upon entry and activation, he discovered that the body was 
2 CONC lame and needed support from an iron crutch. But beggars can't be choosers  and LI-TIEGUAI was throroughly beggared. He knew it was now or never  and, as it turned out, 'now' meant for ever and ever. 
2 CONC He'd become immortal. So he made the best of it. And now, in his immortal and immutable state, he is very popular with the disabled. In fact he's reached the status of patron diety to the sick.  Entry

1 NOTE middle-eastern mythology
1 NOTE Also known as LILITU, NIN-LILLILITH: Primordial First Female and Scandalously Sexy Feminist Demon. According to legend, she was created before Eve, and tempted ADAM in the Garden of Eden. This was quite 
2 CONC a feat as she was a bit scaly and had wings. (Prototypes are always subject to experimental flaws). LILITH saw herself as more than equal to any man, and regarded ADAM as a wimp. She even refused to 
2 CONC let him lie on top of her. Her preference for being on top scandalised just about everyone. Particularly Adam who knew nothing of the Feminist Position. Not caring for gardening or flower arranging, 
2 CONC LILITH flew off to become a Hell's Angel and cavort with way-out Demons. GOD, who was having enough problems coping with his Kwik-Fit World Assembly Kit and whether to stay Jewish or not, sent some Angels 
2 CONC to fetch her back to Heaven. They didn't have much luck  Sanvi, Sanssanvi and Semangalef were told if they didn't flap off she was going to fly around at night and suck the blood of babies. Terrified 
2 CONC of LILITH and nervous of going back empty-handed, they reached a compromise. If they left their names as goodwill tokens, babies would be spared. So if you have worries about a new baby, all you 
2 CONC have to do is scribble the Angel names on a scrap of paper and tape them to the baby's head. Or get a proper armulet made. We are told LILITH has a flourishing mail order business somewhere. LILITH claims 
2 CONC Bad Girl status back to Canaan times. She claims to be the 'Night Devil' in Isaiah xxxiv but prefers 'She of The Night'. Not so keen on 'The Night Hag'. There was a bit of pushing in the subsequent 
2 CONC Garden of Eden makeover  Christian propaganda artists have depicted the Serpent with the face of LILITH. She probably whoops with joy as it enhances her 'Bad Girl' image. She and her gang delight 
2 CONC in seducing and weakening men in the still of the night, but so far has kept away from divorce courts. Some of her compatriots are Eisheth Zenumin, The Angel of Prostitution, Naamam, and Mahlaht who is 
2 CONC a bit uppity and regards herself as 'Fly-by-Night' competition. But as LILITH says, "who has ever heard of the silly bitch?" On the nature conservation front, LILITH is crazy about owls and is seldom

2 CONC a huge three-legged toad. It was his best friend, his magical pet, and would carry him anywhere he wished. Sometimes the toad would hide in a well and have to be coaxed out with a shiny gold coin. This 
2 CONC must have had some deep mystical significance, as LIU-HAI is now revered as a God of Prosperity. Images and carvings of him are everywhere, standing on his toad and juggling gold coins with a beaming 
2 CONC grin. A small statue of him (and his toad) in your house will bring the cash flooding in  and if you stick his image on your wallet you may well become a millionaire. (At least, that's what the New 
2 CONC Age stores claim, and they've certainly made a packet out of him.) As well as doing conjuring tricks with coins, he is also the protector of needlemakers. This really needled us for a while, until we

1 NOTE norse mythology
1 NOTE Also known as LODER, LOKE, LOKKJU, LOPTER, LOPTILOKI: God of Hokey Pokey and one of the world's major Trickster Gods. In his early days LOKI was a rascal; crafty, sneaky, silly and malicious  a Loki The 
2 CONC Lad. The son of two Giants, he was so outrageously mischievous that he even sneaked his way into becoming a God. He was the first Anti-Hero, quick-witting his way out of the tight corners and confrontations 
2 CONC caused by his misdeeds. But as time wore on he became increasingly nasty. His first escapade was a very rampant romp. When the Gods were struggling to build ASGARD, they found they'd run out 
2 CONC of funds. Which is not surprising as money and banks hadn't been invented yet. All the basic construction had been completed but they needed a large protective wall to keep the riff-raff out. LOKI came 
2 CONC up with the plan of contracting a Giant to do the job. As payment, the Giant asked for the Sun and Moon and also the Goddess FREYA if the work was completed to schedule. The Gods were not too sure. 
2 CONC "Don't worry," advised LOKI. "He'll never manage it on his own, even if he works night and day  and the deal will be off. We'll let him keep the wheelbarrow or something." Alas, the Giant was not on 
2 CONC his own. He had a huge stallion called Svadilfari, which could haul boulders like there was no tomorrow. With three days to go, FREYA was in distress and the Gods aghast. Now LOKI, like fire and smoke, 
2 CONC was a shape-changer from the word go. A talent he'd developed to make him the shiftiest transmogrifier of all time  from flea to fish to fast flying feathers in 0.3 seconds. So he changed himself into 
2 CONC a mare and seduced the Giant's stallion. By whinnying and prancing off into the woods, Svadilfari was led far away from the stone pile. With his horse missing, the Giant didn't quite make the schedule. 
2 CONC Seething with rage, he tried to take FREYA by force  until THOR cracked his skull with his hammer. Meanwhile LOKI was having a fine old time frolicking in the fields. In fact he became pregnant, 
2 CONC and decided to sample the joys of motherhood. He gave birth to a fine baby boy stallion with eight legs. He gave this as a gift to ODIN and it was called SLEIPNIR. LOKI was now well in with top God ODIN 
2 CONC and his son THOR, with whom he shared numerous adventures. THOR, the perfect fall guy, was persuaded to appear in drag as the prospective bride of a giant and other embarrassments. THOR could always 
2 CONC be relied on to supply the muscle when corners became too tight for trickery. LOKI had many run-ins with the dwarves, which he cheated at any opportunity until they stitched him up. Literally. They 
2 CONC stitched his mouth shut, which kept him quiet for quite some time. LOKI never missed an opportunity to take advantage of any Goddess, despite already having had three wives. The first not many folk know 
2 CONC about, and it is only by assiduous research we have discovered GLUT, who bore two daughters EINMYRIA and EISA. Next was ANGRBODA, a giantess who spawned FENRIR the Giant Wolf, JORMUNGAND the Earth-encircling 
2 CONC Serpent, and HEL the Underworld Goddess. Finally there was his wife SIGYN, who produced their ill-fated sons NARVI and VALI(2). For further LOKI adventures, click your way to ANDVARI, FAFNIR, 
2 CONC GEIRROD, THIASSI and BALDUR. And check out our Loki Trickster Wearables! We are still investigating the mysterious theft of FREYA's precious necklace Brisingamen when a flea was seen to flee the scene. 
2 CONC As a well-known God of bed-hopping, fingers of suspicion are already pointing at you-know-who. As the most scandalous God of all time, LOKI was seldom out of the Nordic News or the Sunday Runes. 
2 CONC But his tricks came to an end after causing the death of BALDUR. Now he's trapped in eternal punishment until RAGNAROK rolls around.  Entry last modified on 14 November 2005

1 NAME LU-BAN

1 NOTE chinese mythology
1 NOTE Also known as LU-PANLU-BAN: High-flying God of Carpenters and Masons. Need a new loo? LU-BAN is responsible for some of the most amazing Chinese architecture, in particular the dragon motifs which decorate 
2 CONC many ancient temples. And thereby hangs a (dragon's) tale... It seems that LU-BAN was drawing up blueprints for a wonderful new building. Stuck for inspiration, he visited AO-KUANG, the Dragon King 
2 CONC of the Eastern Ocean, to ask if he might possibly use his magnificent Underwater Crystal Palace as a template. The King was highly flattered. "Very well," he said, "I'll have it delivered first thing 
2 CONC in the morning. But I'll need it back in three days; I'm expecting company."As promised, the palace was flown over by a team of dragons and LU-BAN set to work on his own version. Unfortunately, the 
2 CONC palace was so impressively built that after three days he'd only managed to lay a few foundations and order the timber. He wanted more time... Along came the dragons to collect the palace. With a nod 
2 CONC to LU-BAN, they clustered around the building and began to lift. Funny, it wouldn't budge. They heaved and strained but it was stuck fast. LU-BAN had nailed it to the ground. That night the Dragon King 
2 CONC was furious. He sent an army of dragons, crabs and sea monsters, but none of them had ever seen a nail before. The palace remained firmly in place. As the sun rose on the fourth day, the sea creatures 
2 CONC scuttled back to the sea, but the dragons kept straining to lift the building. It was a very hot day, the sun dried them out, and they all collapsed from heat exhaustion. To LU-BAN's amazed delight, 
2 CONC their dried-out bodies curled around the palace and around each other, and presented an awesomely impressive spectacle. He immediately tore up his blueprints and began plans for a range of Dragon 
2 CONC Temples. These were highly successful and are still seen in China today. LU-BAN is also credited with inventing the first flying machine, a kite-like object made of wood. The flying dragons probably inspired 
2 CONC that too. In fact he may even have used it to escape the Dragon King's wrath.  Entry last modified on 25 April 2004

1 NOTE LUMALUMA: God of Gluttony and Gate-crashing. He started off as a whale who came ashore at Cape Stewart in the guise of a man who knew sacred rituals which he was happy to share. However, when it came 
2 CONC to food, he took more than his share, declaring himself sacred so that only he could eat at feasts. Consequently everyone stopped inviting him, but this made no difference as he turned up anyway. He only 
2 CONC had to see smoke from a fire and he could time his arrival to perfection. (We all know people like that.) Fed up with eating left-over scraps, LUMALUMA became partial to consuming dead children. That 
2 CONC was the final straw and a seething mob set upon him and his two wives with sticks and stones and spears. Like an ancient martyr he took some time to die. Partly because he was as big as a whale but 
2 CONC mostly because he asked them to slow down so he could make sure they understood all his sacred rituals. When they thought he was dead enough, they propped his body against a tree, tied it in place with 
2 CONC ropes, and built a shade hut over him using branches. Rumour has it that he didn't die after all but returned to the sea as a whale.  Entry last modified on 31 December 2002

2 CONC fingers or toes it's down to him. A member of the TUATHA-DE-DANANN clan, Big Mac rules the sea, forecasts the weather and looks after Mag Mell, the Seaside Town of the Dead. Realms of the deceased

1 NAME MANES
1 NOTE roman mythology
1 NOTE Also known as DI-MANESMANES: The Deified Dead. In other words, ancestor worship with a Roman twist. Not content with having deities for every conceivable occasion, object and concept, the Romans even 
2 CONC turned themselves into Gods. This was a typically self-indulgent exercise as you might imagine. To become a God, all you had to do was die. Preferably leaving a few pots of gold behind to remind your 
2 CONC relatives of their noble duty. It was quite easy. You just got worshipped a bit. Nothing in JUPITER's league, of course. Perhaps the merest mention during a list of invocations. A smallish statue in your 
2 CONC honor bearing the legend 'Dis Manibus' (to the Divine Souls). Modest shrine facilities. Of course, by definition, if something is worshipped it must therefore be a deity in the opinion of its worshipper. 
2 CONC So when the Romans worshipped their ancestors, they were quite literally turning them into Gods. This practice was in everyone's interest. In return for a little consideration, the dead could 
2 CONC look kindly upon the living and ensure health and happiness all round. And with the prospect of divinity to look forward to, death may well have lost its sting. With such a mutually beneficial system, 
2 CONC even the bitterest of family feuds could turn out nicely in the end.  Entry last modified on 23 June 2006

2 CONC 8: The Mares Of Diomedes  Fresh from the capture of the CRETAN-BULL, his next task sounded simple enough: "Collect the Four Mares belonging to King Diomedes of Thrace." EURYSTHEUS gave him further details. 
2 CONC "So the King is a nasty piece of work, the son of ARES the War God. He is ruler of the Bistones, who relish a bit of grievous bodily harm." So far so good. HERACLES decided he could afford to take 
2 CONC a few menials  and how about a few bags of oats to keep the Mares happy? "Have I overlooked anything? Oh yes. The Mares only eat human flesh." There's always a catch, thought HERACLES. Herc decided 
2 CONC to move fast on this one. A surprise attack took care of the grooms, and he hustled and rustled the mares to the top of a small hill before they knew what was happening. The Mares were left in charge 
2 CONC of Abderus, one of Herc's minions. They were fastened with chain as they would have eaten through reins. Someone sounded the alarm. The Bistones were coming. Thanks to his experience at the AUGEAN-STABLES, 
2 CONC HERACLES now had amazing stable-washing techniques. He dashed back to deal with the Bistones and furiously dug a channel to the nearby coast, flooding the plain the Bistones were charging across. 
2 CONC Amidst the confusion, HERACLES charged in, smote Diomedes who was leading the pursuit, dragged him round the newly-formed lake and up the small hill. The Bistones who were not drowned or containers 
2 CONC for arrows decided to call it a day. Now where was Abderus? Oh dear, the Mares had eaten him. They still seemed rather peckish so HERACLES gave the Diomedes to eat as well. From afar the Bistones shuddered

2 CONC couldn't remember his name so called him MAUI. We have no idea what this means, probably something like 'Oi Yu' or 'Thingy'. His dad seemed quite pleased to see him however,  and gave him a magic fishhook 
2 CONC called Manai-Ka-Lani which meant he would be able to catch his own fish. He tried to go fishing with his brothers again but they threw him out of the canoe. He kept pestering, and one day they relented 
2 CONC and he had some big catches, but when he pulled them up they became islands. He also showed off and hooked the sun to make it move more slowly. After this of course he became an unbearable smart-ass, 
2 CONC discovered playing with fire and showing off at every opportunity in the best trickster tradition. He eventually came to a very tricky end. Finding HINENUITEPO the Goddess asleep, he became very 
2 CONC curious because she was a Big lady. We are talking colossal here. MAUI thought it would be fun to walk through her body  starting from an entrance not normally accessible. Now HINENUITEPO was not sleeping

2 CONC  and hallucinogenic properties to match. A few nibbles at the iboga root will send you soaring into a drug-induced world of weirdness. You may even get religion  which is exactly how the Bwiti cult 
2 CONC began. MEBEGHE seems to be a tripped-out take on the three-in-one Creator God NZAME. An afternoon munching iboga must have given a completely new angle on everyone's favorite God. We're not sure what 
2 CONC kind of angle, but without the benefit of mind-enhancing substances we'll just have to try our best. Before you can make a cosmic omelette you have to make a Cosmic Egg. You will need underarm hair, 
2 CONC a piece of brain, and a pebble from the sea. You will also need to be a God like MEBEGHE. You can then blow on the ingredients and your egg will form. Hand it to a spider to hang between sky and sea 
2 CONC and cook it in sunshine. When it is hot you must fertilize it. Then when it cracks you have descendants. This is the exciting bit. In MEBEGHE's case there burst forth NINEPONE and her brother NONE. Shortly 
2 CONC followed by the strange and unsettling EVUS. There are more exciting recipes to create worms and termites. These in turn dish up a big ball of dung which becomes Earth Pudding. There may also be 
2 CONC animals, birds, plants, and giant triangular zootfroodles, depending on how much iboga you happen to be chewing. MEBEGHE's three new deities were placed upon the Earth and told to behave themselves. 
2 CONC Needless to say, they didn't. It wasn't long before sex and drugs and dead warthogs had ruined all chance of a happy ending. The cult of Bwiti is still going strong in several parts of Gabon and Cameroon. 
2 CONC There are many strenuous rituals to deal with and also a lot of complicated secret handshakes. Meanwhile, MEBEGHE has found new fame in the West as Zame-Ye-Mebege, the Discordian God of Narcotics.

2 CONC a female warrior called MACHA and forced her to run a race whilst heavily pregnant. She won of course but cursed all Ulster men to suffer childbirth pangs whenever they engaged in conflict. They 
2 CONC laughed, but MACHA was related to MORRIGAN, a Goddess not to be messed with. So when conflict started MEDB had the MORRIGAN and MACHA's curse on her side. CUCHULAINN was impervious to such things and 
2 CONC carried on regardless as his men writhed on the ground. There was a weak spot. In his quest for fame and glory Cuchulainn had dismissed immortality as only fit for wimps. The MORRIGAN had tried to persuade 
2 CONC him he was not going to win this fight, but he spurned her advances and was forced to lash himself to a rock. Mortally wounded, he fought to the last gasp, with MORRIGAN in crow form perched on 
2 CONC his shoulder. When Christianity arrived, MEDB was taken down a few notches and faced relegation in the form of Mab, spiteful Queen of the Fairies. Think of that the next time you see Queen Mab in A

1 NAME MEDEA
1 SEX F
1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE MEDEA: A bitch of a witch who could get away with murder. Daughter of King Aeetes of Pontus, she was well into sorcery when Jason and his Argonauts came to capture the Gold Fleece owned by the king. MEDEA 
2 CONC took one look at the handsome hero and decided "He's mine!" She took it upon herself to help him fleece her father. She protected Jason from all the impossible tasks he was given, which included 
2 CONC ploughing with flaming bulls, sowing dragon's teeth that turned into warriors and getting past the dragon itself that guarded the fleece. Her unguents, ointments and spells never failed and Jason romped 
2 CONC through the trials. This made Aeetes furious and a final straw was added when MEDEA ran off with Jason, slowing down pursuit by chopping up a young brother and scattering bits and pieces on the way. 
2 CONC Reaching Thessaly she got up to all sorts of mischief, such as inciting the daughters of King Pelius to chop up their father and boil the bits in a pot to rejuvenate him. A hasty exit to Corinth followed, 
2 CONC with Jason in tow. Here she seemed to settle down for a bit and they had two sons. Now it was Jason's turn to go off the rails and he chased after Creusa, daughter of the King of Corinth. MEDEA 
2 CONC sent her a special wedding present, a tunic and a crown which burst into flame, after which she slaughtered her two children to teach Jason a lesson. She had to make another swift exit. She was seen 
2 CONC leaving the city in a chariot drawn by winged serpents. Next she married King Ageus of Athens and tried to poison his son THESEUS when he turned up to see his estranged father. Another swift exit. Did 
2 CONC she come to a bad end? Not a bit of it. She is now reputed to be romping around in the Elysian Fields with ACHILLES.  Entry last modified on 06 December 2004

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE MEMNON: Son of EOS and Ethiopian leader Tithonus, MEMNON was the Trojan hero who finally came up in single combat against Achilles and lost. As he was being buried ZEUS thought a little bit of immortality 
2 CONC would be in order, and MEMNON was awarded his own flock of birds called Memnomides which could come and visit his grave. He never really came back himself and EOS still weeps tears of dew for him. 
2 CONC Now there happens to be two massive statues which were once a tribute to Amenhotep the Third of Egypt. These were later neglected and damaged slightly by an earthquake. This gave one of them a mystical 
2 CONC significance as it emitted weird moaning noises in the wind. When the Greeks came across it they were delighted to discover the strange 'speaking' statue and some bright spark decided maybe MEMNON 
2 CONC had come back after all and was trying to tell them something. Over the centuries, MEMNON became something of a tourist attraction and at one time Hadrian himself popped over to have a look. Even though 
2 CONC he had to wait two days for MEMNON to speak to him, he was impressed. Hadrian had his personal poetess Julia Balbilla carve a poem on the statue in praise of himself and MEMNON, which proves he was 
2 CONC not above a bit of gratuitous graffiti. 'Hadrian was here' rather than Kilroy. You can of course check it out for yourself as the statues still stand. But we cannot guarantee MEMNON will speak to you. 
2 CONC A refurbishment by Septimus Severus somewhere around 200 A.D. seemed to sever all articulation and MEMNON has never uttered a stutter since. We won't tell you exactly where in Egypt the statues may 
2 CONC be found as we don't want any more tourists carving their names and dropping litter around poor old MEMNON.  Entry last modified on 12 February 2004

2 CONC taken from the Latin tag 'Mens Sana in Corpore Sano', which of course any Mensa member will tell you means 'A Healthy Mind in a Healthy Body'. It just so happens that the Latin word Mensa means table 
2 CONC according to our translations. Do they think around tables? Just because your mind is of higher things and you tend to trip over undone shoelaces and walk into walls a lot does not mean you need to visit 
2 CONC a gym. With the pounding you already subject your body to, it is obvious it is always being tested to the limit. Here is a little test for you. If MEN himself is depicted with a Thysis in his right

2 CONC is the Buddhist Goddess who dishes out the Bittersweet Broth of Oblivion. This is a mystic brew made from herbs and pond water which she prepares for the souls of the dead. She is waiting for you at 
2 CONC the Ninth Chinese Hell in FENG-DU, where your soul will be ready to leave the recycling centre and head for the reincarnation door. One sip of her Five-Flavored Tea of Forgetfulness and you will lose 
2 CONC all memory of who you were. This ensures that when you are reborn you can start with a clean slate. The only thing that passes from one incarnation to the next is Karma, which is why no-one remembers 
2 CONC their past lives. This amnesia is supposed to be an act of mercy. It may not seem fair to lose the wisdom and knowledge you accumulate during your life  but on the other hand it does prevent cheating. 
2 CONC There is no known antidote to Lady Meng's potion (although some people claim that hypnotic regression can help you remember past lives). Only BUDDHA himself managed to shake off the effects  after meditation

2 CONC with rampant speculation, and Easter Island attracts cranks like you wouldn't believe. The mystery is enhanced by the fact that most of the MOAI weigh a truly ridiculous amount of tons. How did the primitive

1 NOTE Also known as SUN-WUKONG, SUN-WU-KONG, SUN-WU-K'UNG, SUN-HOU-ZI, SUN-HOU-TZE, PI-MA-WENMONKEY: The infamous irrepressible Monkey King, Trickster God, and Great Sage Equal Of Heaven. Star of stage, screen 
2 CONC and scroll, MONKEY is the true hero of Journey To The West (Xiyou Ji)   the amazing novel of frivolity and profundity written by Wu Cheng'en in the Sixteenth Century. (It's one of China's Four Great 
2 CONC Novels, and we highly recommend it to anyone seeking enlightenment or entertainment.) From the beginning of time, a certain rock on the Mountain of Fruit and Flowers had been soaking up the goodness 
2 CONC of nature and QI energy. One day this pregnant rock released a stone egg, and from it hatched a Stone Ape, who solemnly bowed to the Four Corners of the Earth  then jumped off to have fun. This was 
2 CONC MONKEY. He was high-spirited, egotistical and full of mischievous pranks. He was soon having a wonderful time as King of the Apes. But a niggling worry began to gnaw at him  one which would change his 
2 CONC life. The Monkey King feared Death. To find immortality, MONKEY became the disciple of Father Subodhi, a rather dour DAOist sage. The sage, unimpressed with his simian tricks, gave the Monkey King a 
2 CONC new title: 'Disciple Aware of Emptiness'. MONKEY was very pleased with this epithet, not realising it referred to the vacuum in his head. But after much haggling, Father Subodhi uttered the words of Illumination, 
2 CONC explained the process of Cloud-Flying  and also revealed the secret of the Seventy-Two Transformations. Which, thought MONKEY, was extremely good value for money. Returning home to his monkey 
2 CONC subjects, he discovered they were under seige by a fearsome monster. Magic tricks were no good  what he needed was a weapon. So he whizzed off to the Dragon King AO-KUANG and cajoled his way into 
2 CONC the Treasury. There he found the great Magic Wishing Staff, a huge rod of black iron which Heaven had used to flatten the bed of the Milky Way. It weighed 13,000 pounds but could expand to fill the Universe 
2 CONC or shrink to the size of a needle. MONKEY was delighted with this Weapon of Mass Destruction and used it to bludgeon many a demon thereafter. It wasn't long before reports of MONKEY's tricks started 
2 CONC to reach the austere ears of the JADE-EMPEROR. First the DRAGON-KINGS complained of rudeness and theft. Then YEN-LO-WANG, the God of Death, lodged a formal protest. "That intolerable ape has just 
2 CONC vandalised my filing system and made monkeys immortal. What are you going to do about it?" Not wishing to shed needless karma, the JADE-EMPEROR invited MONKEY to Heaven and gave him a job. Without 
2 CONC pay, of course. This plan to keep the peace was amazingly successful for an entire day. Then MONKEY discovered that his post as Keeper of the Heavenly Stables was so lowly, even the horse manure ranked 
2 CONC higher than him. Insulted beyond belief, MONKEY ran amok, burst into the JADE-EMPEROR's court and dared to threaten his august person. The Ruler of the Universe sighed, consulted his advisors and bestowed 
2 CONC a new title upon him: Great Sage, Equal Of Heaven. "That's much better," said MONKEY, impressed. But by his very nature the Great Sage was irrepressibly naughty. He just couldn't help it. He gobbled 
2 CONC up LAO-ZI's Longevity Pills, stuffed his face with the precious Peaches of Immortality, gatecrashed official parties and made insulting gestures to all and sundry. Finally he left Heaven in disgust, 
2 CONC claiming it wasn't good enough for him. Now the JADE-EMPEROR finally lost his esteemed cool. He sent the Heavenly army to obliterate MONKEY once and for all. Nothing could withstand this mighty force... 
2 CONC But the Great Stone Ape  immortal, spiritually illumined and filled with Heavenly essences  was not only indestructable but also pretty handy in a fight. The forces of Heaven made an embarrassing 
2 CONC display and slunk off in defeat. There was nothing for it  the Ruler of Heaven called for BUDDHA. Now BUDDHA, in his infinite wisdom, knew better than to subdue MONKEY by force. Instead he offered 
2 CONC him a wager. "If you're so clever, jump off the palm of my hand. If you can do that, I'll take the Emperor in as a lodger and give Heaven to you. But if you can't, I'll expect a full apology and penance." 
2 CONC The Monkey King laughed to himself. He could travel thousands of miles in a single leap. The bet was on. BUDDHA stretched out his hand and MONKEY jumped... Several thousand miles later, the Great 
2 CONC Sage landed in a desolate plain with great columns reaching up the sky. "These must be the Five Pillars of Wisdom at the end of the Universe", he thought. "That BUDDHA is just plain stupid to make such 
2 CONC a silly bet." And, to show his disrespect, he pissed all over the nearest pillar and jumped back to claim his reward. "Is the Emperor packing his bags yet?" asked MONKEY as he landed. The Holy One 
2 CONC raised a sublime eyebrow. "I don't know why you're grinning," he said, "you've been on my palm the whole time. Look." An astonished MONKEY rubbed his eyes and stared at the five familiar-looking pink 
2 CONC pillars of BUDDHA's hand. Then he smelt the stench of monkey pee and trembled. The next thing he knew, he was lying on the ground with a mountain on top of him. And there he stayed for five hundred long 
2 CONC years, being fed molten copper and iron pills by an attendent demon while the moss grew in his ears. By the time GUAN-YIN came along, the Great Sage Equal of Heaven was a thoroughly humble creature. 
2 CONC As told in Journey To The West, GUAN-YIN enlisted MONKEY as chief disciple of the young Buddhist monk TRIPITAKA. Together with SANDY and PIGSY, he protected the boy on his quest to India, battling 
2 CONC demons and righting wrongs along the way. His natural monkey trickery now had a holy purpose which he unleashed with much enthusiasm  and his uncontrollable ego was kept firmly in place by a little device 
2 CONC of GUAN-YIN's devising: a head-band made of gold. The unsuspecting Great Sage was not prepared for the terrible torture of the Headache Sutra! Whenever MONKEY misbehaved, TRIPITAKA recited the Sutra 
2 CONC and the golden fillet squeezed until his very eyeballs felt like bursting. Try as he might, he could not remove it. There was no defense except submission, and pretty soon MONKEY was the most humble 
2 CONC disciple the world has ever known. Usually. After many many many many adventures, the travellers fulfilled their quest. MONKEY was rewarded for all his efforts with the title 'Buddha Victorious Against 
2 CONC Disaster' and finally made his peace with Heaven. We don't know what the Great Sage gets up to nowadays, but presumably he keeps himself occupied.  Entry last modified on 29 August 2006

2 CONC good pedigree in the Greek Slumberland World. While his brothers PHOBETOR and PHANTASOS veer toward the more bizarre scenarios, MORPHEUS specialises in ultra-realistic dreams  of the kind where you 
2 CONC find yourself naked at the office party. When he stands beckoning in the twilight of your dreams, girls looking for nocturnal pleasure will be unlucky, for they will be very much on their own. We reckon 
2 CONC further research needs to be done on this beckoning business. Of his private life, very little is known. He sleeps in a darkened cave with Poppy, but who is she? Vague rumors circulate that this 
2 CONC could be Opium Poppy. Which explains a lot. Yet in most tomes of Greek geekishness he is a sadly neglected figure. Scholars appear to have dozed off at the very mention of his name and indexes bear witness 
2 CONC to this indolence. Perhaps MORPHEUS himself has encouraged this fading dream memory with his metaphorical metamorphosis into a shadowy handsome figure waiting in the wings of the dusk. His legacy 
2 CONC is Morphine, named after him and found in most medical works, so think of him as medical history. He is also known as the Sandman, but you can call him Sandy for short.  Entry last modified on 28 June

2 CONC She was one of the original members of the TUATHA-DE-DANANN (People of the Goddess DANU) who chose Ireland as their Headquarters. This was good preparation for battle and shenanigans as the Fir 
2 CONC Bolgs had to be defeated first. As a shape-changer she can turn from ravishing beauty to hag, from battle crow to BEAN-NIGHE, all in triple time. This has caused a great deal of confusion to careless 
2 CONC mythologists and innocent Godcheckers. Some sources claim there is three of her. But as her sisters BADB and NEMAIN usually join in the fray, this is not surprising. There could have been more as FEA, 
2 CONC FOTLA and NEMAIN, other warrior Goddess compatriots with shapechanging abilities, were hardly likely to sit on the sidelines when things got exciting. With crows wheeling and shrieking and startling 
2 CONC transformations going on, who is going to stop to count? Especially when you are fleeing in terror, knowing they always picked the winning side. When MEDB The Queen of Connaught employed the MORRIGAN 
2 CONC Mob in her battle against Ulster and CUCHULAINN, more confusion was caused  as MEDB is similar to BADB. BADB was not as bad as MEDB, and the MORRIGAN forces used fear itself as a weapon rather than adding 
2 CONC to the slaughter. MORRIGAN does have a loving side to her nature, and gave the Irish Hero CUCHULAINN every chance to make love not war. But would he listen? That's why he is now only commemorated

1 NAME MOSES
1 SEX M
1 NOTE middle-eastern mythology
1 NOTE Also known as MUSAMOSES: The Great Prophet of Judaism, the leading light of the Israelites, and GOD's right-hand man. It was a bad time for the Israelites. They'd been subjugated by a certain Egyptian 
2 CONC Pharaoh to a life of bondage and misery. But along came MOSES, a Hebrew chap who also happened to be an adopted Egyptian prince. YAHWEH appeared to him in the form of a burning bush on the side of a 
2 CONC mountain and issued a rescue plan  with MOSES as chief perpetrator. Close encounters with God are very rare. So we have to feel some admiration for MOSES, who kept his head in the midst of omnipresence 
2 CONC and asked God the kind of personal questions we'd all like the answers to. YAHWEH was not entirely forthcoming but it was worth a try. But when God started giving him detailed religio-political instructions 
2 CONC for confronting kings and leading an entire nation out of slavery, MOSES was not enthusiastic. "Hang on a minute," he said. "You're telling me to do all this big stuff, but I don't even know 
2 CONC you. It's all very well terrifying me into submission, but if this relationship is going to work, it has to be a two-way thing." And so God uttered his Holy Name YHWH  and MOSES was terrified into submission. 
2 CONC From that moment, MOSES became the High Priest of the Israelites. And also their Prophet, Divine Interpreter and Chief Hygiene Officer. His Princely Egyptian status got him the ear of the Pharaoh, 
2 CONC but the ear was a little hard of hearing. Cries of "Let my people go!" were met with insults, and MOSES realised this was gonna be a tough job. "My God is bigger than your God," he said. "Prove 
2 CONC it," said the Pharaoh. There followed a series of meetings in which MOSES contested against the very best Egyptian wizards. Sticks were transformed into snakes, rabbits were pulled from hats, and glamorous 
2 CONC mummies were sawn in half to thunderous applause. The power of YAHWEH amazed everyone, but the sorcerers managed to duplicate every trick and the Pharaoh yawned. Finally MOSES lost his rag and conjured 
2 CONC up plagues of boils, locusts, frogs, gnats and other unspeakable nasties. Only the Israelites remained unscathed and boil-free. But still the Pharaoh yawned... until YAHWEH himself struck down 
2 CONC the firstborn of Egypt  including the Pharaoh's own son. Suddenly he couldn't wait to get rid of the Israelites, who were banished from Egypt and led into the desert wilderness by a triumphant MOSES. 
2 CONC He didn't stay triumphant for long. The people complained about the dust, the lack of provisions, and pretty much everything else. In his mercy, the Lord sent sustenance: a white flakey foodstuff which 
2 CONC tasted like honey. This appeared every morning without fail  except on the Sabbath, which was God's day off. Luckily he provided a double helping the day before. The Israelites called this mysterious 
2 CONC food Manna, which means 'what is it?' To this day no-one knows exactly what it was, but they lived on the stuff for forty years so it must have done them some good. Still the people grumbled. Needing 
2 CONC guidance, MOSES went to consult with YAHWEH, who provided two stone tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments. Many more were to follow. In fact there were so many regulations that the Israelites 
2 CONC could hardly blow their own noses without permission. When it came to Thou Shalt Not, the sheer number of unclean practices and detestable bodily functions mentioned was enough to make anyone feel ill. 
2 CONC Many of these rules were practical tips for keeping a society healthy under difficult circumstances. But to the common people it just seemed like an excuse for MOSES to boss them around. Which, to 
2 CONC be perfectly honest, he did. A complex array of sacrificial rituals ensured that a new legion of richly-paid priests could spend all their time tending to God while the common people paid in hard cash. 
2 CONC As the Lord sayeth: "No-one is to appear before me empty-handed." (Exodus 34:20). YAHWEH was so pleased at these achievements that he deigned to hear a humble request: MOSES wanted to see God's face. 
2 CONC But YAHWEH is nothing if not bashful when it comes to physical appearance. "No-one shall see me and live," he said. MOSES begged and pleaded for a glimpse of the Almighty  and God took pity on him. 
2 CONC "Go into that cave behind you and cover your eyes," he said. MOSES did so. After a few moments, the voice of God spoke: "Okay, you can look now!" MOSES uncovered his eyes and stared out of the cave. And 
2 CONC beheld in all its glory the eternal radiance and holy majesty of God's behind. The sight was so overpoweringly radiant that afterwards MOSES's face gleamed with a supernatural glow. And here's a funny 
2 CONC thing. The original Hebrew text states: 'The skin of his face shone'. But many centuries later, Roman translators poring over this vowel-deprived language were faced with two alternate readings: 1) 
2 CONC Sent forth beams, or 2) Sent forth horns. Of course they plumped for the second version. And thus the tradition arose that MOSES sprouted horns. No less an artist than Michelangelo himself fell for 
2 CONC that one. Meanwhile, after forty years of wandering the desert, the Israelites finally reached Canaan, the Promised Land. But MOSES didn't quite make it. After a lifetime of devoted service, YAHWEH punished 
2 CONC him for an incident which was apparently too trivial to even put on record. So MOSES blessed his people, gave an incredibly long and repetitive farewell speech, and died within sight of the Promised 
2 CONC Land.  Entry last modified on 22 July 2005

2 CONC in humble reeds, he turned up at the interview to discover only one other candidate had applied for the job. Possibly because the winning applicant was required to undergo sacrifical death in the 
2 CONC Godly Bonfire. Oh well, he thought, what have I got to lose? He'd only been invited to attend because he'd done good works and given maize to humans. His rival was the smartly-dressed and terribly arrogant

1 NOTE NERGAL: Underworld God. A bit of a bully in bull form, with lots of bellowing, roaring and raping.  When the Sumerian Gods were having a bit of a beano, they realized that ERESHKIGAL was stuck on duty 
2 CONC down in the Underworld  the one ruling job that is reliant on you being in residence. You can't nip out for the merest moment without all hell breaking loose. So they invited her to send her minister 
2 CONC NAMTAR up so they could give him a doggy bag full of delicacies for her. As a mark of respect all the Gods paid homage to NAMTAR as the representative of ERESHKIGAL. All but one  NERGAL  who just snorted

2 CONC work out like that because NERGAL hid in the gents or something and could not be found. This was not good enough for ERESHKIGAL who dashed off a very terse appeal to the Gods on official Underworld 
2 CONC clay tablet. Worded in a fashion they would be wise not to ignore. At last NERGAL panicked and asked his dad EA for help. Dad supplied him with seven pairs of demons to accompany him. The demons hustled 
2 CONC him through the seven gateways, taking up the position of two demons per gate to persuade the minders that ritual humiliation attempts were not on the agenda. This enabled NERGAL to rush to the Throne 
2 CONC Room and take ERESHKIGAL by surprise. He grabbed her by the hair and put a knife to her throat. Whereby she immediately relinquished the throne and then he repented and shared it with her. Because 
2 CONC he decided that he loved her even more than violence. This is only one of many versions. Having invented writing, the Sumerian Tabloids took off in a big way. Every scribe and hack wanted to test their

2 CONC during flying visits  and NGAI does like to make the occasional business trip to Earth to see how things are going. That's why mountains tend to be breathtakingly beautiful with fabulous scenic 
2 CONC views. The snow-speckled Mount Kenya, originally known as Kirinyaga, was his first port of call after the world was created. Looking down upon the Earth, he decided it needed very careful handling. 
2 CONC So he summoned one of those strange roaming animals with opposable thumbs to the top of the mountain, blessed him, gave him the name Gikuyu, and told him he'd got the job. Along with his wife Mumbi, Gikuyu 
2 CONC founded the mountainside nation which is named after him, while NGAI zoomed off into the sky for an extended vacation  leaving strict orders not to be disturbed under any circumstances. Unfortunately 
2 CONC the new nation got off to an embarrassing start; Gikuyu and Mumbi discovered they could not produce male offspring. With nine daughters and counting, they decided to risk a quick prayer to NGAI 
2 CONC for help. As he'd envisaged a nation somewhat larger than eleven people, NGAI dispatched nine husbands to jump-start the population. Since then, NGAI has remained in semi-aloof mode. He still hates to

1 NOTE NIBELUNGS: Despite having four epic Wagner operas devoted to them, with all the trappings of hard-core mythology at work, information on the underground-dwelling NIBELUNGS is pretty scarce. Our main source 
2 CONC of information is 'The Nibelungenlied', a 13th Century work written in Low, Medium and High German. The NIBELUNGS are revealed to be a race of tough but valiant dwarfs living in the realm of NIFLHEIM. 
2 CONC (A rather disgusting rumor insists they were created by ODIN from the maggots swarming in YMIR's flesh. Ewww.) But they guard a most precious treasure, which is of course the cue for an exciting 
2 CONC tale or two. (See BRYNHILD.) However, can we interest you in a Nebelung? Nebelungs are a breed of cute fluffy kittens which make affectionate, devoted companions. Rumor has it that Wagner was inspired 
2 CONC by them for his opera 'Der Ring Des Nebelungen' (The Ring Of The Cute Fluffy Kittens).  Entry last modified on 12 June 2003

1 NOTE mesopotamian mythology
1 NOTE NINURTA: Eagle God of War and Irrigation. Or could it be irritation? Son of ENLIL and NINHURSAGA, he started off as an eagle and then asked his mum for a lion's head. But this made him aggressively unruly, 
2 CONC so she left his wings and gave him a humanoid body. It didn't do any good. What he liked was playing with thunderbolts and shouting war cries and smashing and killing anything he felt like. Realising 
2 CONC he was out of control, his mother took to hurling rocks at him. These were living things at the time, but it was still no good. NINURTA pounded them into submission and his mother was so disappointed 
2 CONC that she took life away from them. A few of the stones had refused to be used as missiles, so NINURTA turned them into precious stones and jewels just to highlight how mean he could be. One eventful 
2 CONC day, the incredibly precious ME Tablets of Destiny were stolen by ANZU the storm bird. He didn't know quite how to extract the knowledge and was trying to hatch them up in his mountaintop eyrie. 
2 CONC The Gods thought NINURTA's bully boy tactics could at last be put to good use. Happily singing 'Bring On The Clouds' at the top of his unmusical voice, he flew up to ANZU's domain firing off thunderbolts. 
2 CONC This had no effect at all. ANZU had built the Tablets into a protective shield around his nest, and apart from a slight chipping and scarring, the thunderbolts and storm lashings could not inflict 
2 CONC any lasting damage. Baffled, NINURTA rushed back to dad for advice and was told for once in his life to try and use his brains and a bit of Godly cunning. So NINURTA sat and thought until his brain 
2 CONC hurt so much that even he didn't want any loud noises. And then he had an idea... He crept up on ANZU and cast his thickest and darkest clouds over the nest. The mighty bird was baffled and couldn't see 
2 CONC his beak in front of his face. As he peered helplessly into the gloom, NINURTA screamed with delight and stormed the storm bird. He hacked off its head and wings and felt himself again. NINURTA took 
2 CONC the tablets safely back to ENKI. Then it entered his thick skull that he could have kept them for himself. He tried to steal them but at long last the silly old God had taken security precautions. The 
2 CONC Tablets were now kept in a trap containing a monster turtle, which NINURTA crashed straight into after an unexpected shove from ENKI. The turtle pinned him down and NINURTA had to cry for his mum to 
2 CONC come and save his life by pleading with ENKI. He promised never to be naughty again  leaving us with nothing to write about. The End.  Entry last modified on 24 July 2005

1 SEX M
1 NOTE middle-eastern mythology
1 NOTE NOAH: The First Conservationist and GOD's Own Sailor. After that nasty business with ADAM and the Tree of Knowledge, Mankind had become increasingly corrupt. The world was full of wickedness, and humans 
2 CONC did exactly as they pleased. Which was usually something naughty. YAHWEH, the Creator of All, just couldn't do a thing with them. So he decided to kill them  and every other living thing  just to be 
2 CONC on the safe side. For forty days, the Earth was consumed by water until it covered even the tops of mountains. The entire human race, and every land-based creature, was unceremoniously drowned and utterly 
2 CONC wiped out. The whole planet became empty and silent; the Great Flood had destroyed all. Oh, except for one man and his family. His name was NOAH and he was the only one who ever paid YAHWEH the 
2 CONC slightest attention. So naturally his life was spared. He was told to build a huge ark to keep his family safe during the Flood, and to preserve a breeding pair of all the world's animals. Make no mistake, 
2 CONC the ark was huge. It was the height of a four-storey building and the length of a football pitch. With three decks, it had a total capacity of 101,250 sq ft. We have measured this out in the field 
2 CONC and reckon the project may have been viable. But we're still calculating the number of animals it could have carried. Does anyone know the surface area of an elephant? NOAH's neighbors thought he 
2 CONC was crazy when they saw him building this enormous wooden boat in his backyard  and when tigers, worms and aardvarks started to queue up they were ready to call the men in white coats. No-one had ever 
2 CONC seen a kangaroo before. But NOAH had the last laugh when the Heavens opened and whole cities were swept away. Safe in his ark, NOAH spent the next few months tending to his passengers while the flood 
2 CONC waters raged and slowly subsided. YAHWEH had instructed him to bring enough food for every animal, but we can't help wondering where he got the eucalyptus leaves to feed the koala bears. For that matter, 
2 CONC we're not entirely sure how the koala bears managed to get there at all. The dinosaurs certainly didn't make it. NOAH's ark now contained the only surviving animals on the planet. It was thus a haven 
2 CONC for thousands of infinitely precious, critically endangered creatures. We would love to applaud NOAH for being the world's most impressive conservationist, but we can't. Because when the flood waters 
2 CONC finally subsided, a delighted NOAH stepped onto dry land, grabbed some spare animals and... slaughtered them as a sacrifice to the Lord. So much for conservation.   Entry last modified on 23 July

2 CONC bored of lurking and started making a nuisance of himself. After a while he got bored of that too and sneaked around the outskirts of the village. There he bumped into NINEPONE  and the two of them 
2 CONC managed to seduce each other. It was a case of 'keep it in the family' after EVUS persuaded her to seduce her brother too. The world's first case of incest led to the first human beings. But MEBEGHE 
2 CONC was very cross and banished her to the void just underneath the planet. Meanwhile, NONE was faced with a multitude of screaming baby humans and no widwife. It was then that EVUS proved he wasn't entirely 
2 CONC evil  just misunderstood. He sat NONE down and explained to him the secret lore of ironwork, carpentry, bookbinding, textiles and painting. So a relieved and happy NONE set to work  and was able

1 NOTE Also known as NUGUA, NU-KUA, NU-KWA, NU-WANU-GUA: One of the SAN-HUANG, she's the Serpent Creator Goddess of Mankind, Marriage and Mud. After PAN-GU formed the Universe, the primitive Earth was full of 
2 CONC endless mud, upon which roamed depressingly dumb animals. In short, the place was extremely dull. Stifling her yawns, NU-GUA decided to liven things up a bit by creating an exciting new species. There 
2 CONC was plenty of raw material available, even if most of it consisted of brown mud, black mud and yellow mud. Using her own body as a guide, she fashioned new beings from the earth. But they didn't look 
2 CONC right with a huge snaky tail, so she gave them legs instead. These little people took ages to make, but looked beautiful. They ran around worshipping her in a delightful manner and quite touched her 
2 CONC heart. But there weren't nearly enough of them to populate an entire planet, so NU-GUA decided to speed up production by cutting a few corners with the next batch. Dipping a vine into a particularly 
2 CONC foul patch of sloppy mud, she swung it around her head and covered the earth in dollops of humanity for miles around. Okay, so they were ugly, crude and unseemly, but what they lacked in refinement they 
2 CONC made up for in quantity. "Don't worry," she said to the beautiful first batch, "they can be the peasants and do all the work." Having established the human race and also the class system, NU-GUA then 
2 CONC invented sex and marriage, for which everyone was very grateful. It certainly saved her from spending the rest of her existence playing with mud. With her husband FU-XI as first ruler and teacher 
2 CONC of mankind, all was going well. Until monstrous rivals GONG-GONG and ZHU-RONG got into a fight and caused the first Great Flood. Water poured from the Heavens and her human creations were devastated by 
2 CONC the devastation. To restore cosmic harmony, NU-GUA took some brightly colored stones from a river bank, melted them down and used them to repair the hole in the sky. (Although nowhere stated, we imagine 
2 CONC this is a reference to the first rainbow.) She then propped up the Heavens as best she could using the legs of a turtle. (See DA-YU for a slightly less weird version of events.) In some accounts 
2 CONC NU-GUA is snaky, in others she is known as Snail Woman with woman's torso and head. And why not? Our own Holy Snail™ remains inscrutable on the subject and refuses to leave his shell.  Entry last modified

1 NOTE NYAMINYAMI: Half fish and half snake River Deity of the Zambesi river bordering Zimbabwe and Zambia. Sadly he was sentenced to damnation. We can only quote from the journal of Kevin Shankland, who kindly 
2 CONC supplied us with the following account: "He is a very powerful God to the Batonka tribe who were displaced when the Kariba dam was being built in the late 1950/early 1960's. All their tribal lands 
2 CONC were flooded to provide the dam (over 200km long and 30km wide). Many disasters fell when the dam was first built. Several construction workers are buried within the dam wall after falling into wet concrete. 
2 CONC Many drowned in the endeavour to build this dam and countless thousands of wild and endangered African species drowned along with those tribesmen who did not believe that the waters would rise. 
2 CONC Most ran for higher ground but eventually the waters rose, drowning all their livestock, and eventually the waters took their lives too. NYAMINYAMI in his anger feasted on all that was left. And so 
2 CONC did the crocodiles."  Entry last modified on 21 August 2005

2 CONC him blueprints, a handful of mud, a chain, a five-toed chicken, and detailed instructions. Unfortunately, on his way to perform this important task, OBATALA accidentally gatecrashed a Godparty and spent 
2 CONC the rest of the evening roaring drunk on palm wine. Seeing the chance for fame and glory, his younger brother ODUDUWA pinched the holy building materials and attempted to jerry-build the Earth himself. 
2 CONC Advised by a friendly chameleon, he lowered the chain over the edge of heaven, climbed down, and tossed the lump of mud into the primeval sea. The chicken hopped onto the mud and began scratching 
2 CONC it in all directions. Pretty soon there was a decent size landscape and thus was the Earth born. OLORUN was so pleased with ODUDUWA that he promoted him to God of the Earth, while the disgraced and boozy

1 NAME ODIN
1 SEX M
1 NOTE norse mythology
1 NOTE Also known as GANGLERI, ODINN, OTHINN, VAK, VALTAMODIN: The Norse Biggy. ODIN is Father of the Gods, King of ASGARD, Ruler of the AESIR and the Lord of War, Death and Knowledge. To travel the world without 
2 CONC being recognised, he wears a huge wide-brimmed hat. He also  thanks to LOKI  rides an eight-legged horse named SLEIPNIR into battle. All he needs is a six-shooter and a sheriff's badge to be able 
2 CONC to stand in for John Wayne in True Grit. His biggest fans include the Berserkers, which should give you some idea. He's also very hot on Knowledge and Military Intelligence, having two ravens, Huginn 
2 CONC and Muninn, who fly around the world every day bringing up-to-date reports. ODIN himself has only one eye, having traded the other one for a sip from MIMIR's Well of Wisdom during his visit to the great 
2 CONC World Tree YGGDRASIL. Consequently he's full of knowledge, while his missing eye is hidden in an unknown location care of MIMIR the Talking Head. The eye enabled MIMIR to focus on far-distant events, 
2 CONC allowing ODIN the ability to always see far ahead. To become the Top Wise Guy, ODIN put himself through some incredibly rigorous ordeals. The Well of Wisdom lies under the second root of YGGDRASIL, 
2 CONC which allows the Dew of Knowledge to seep into it. So ODIN stabbed himself with his own spear and hung himself on the tree for nine days and nights. He was then allowed a peep, and saw magic runes 
2 CONC appear on rocks beneath him. With a superhuman effort he struggled to lift them, which must have been quite an acrobatic feat. Running his eye over the mystic symbols, he was instantly freed of all encumbrances; 
2 CONC restored and rejuvenated with everlasting vigour enabling him to drop lightly to the ground. His ordeal accomplished, ODIN was at last able to take a well-deserved swig from MIMIR's well, 
2 CONC making him well-wise as well as wise. It was even tastier than his usual tipple Kvas, the Mead of Inspiration, a special brew made from the blood of KVASIR. If you think a wise one-eyed Norse cowboy on 
2 CONC an eight-legged horse would be easy to recognise, this ain't necessarily so for ODIN is a shape-changer, and his range of disguises make Sherlock Holmes look like Miss Marple. He also travels incognito 
2 CONC under a variety of false names. Sharing primeval God status with brothers VE and VILI, the Great ODIN helped bring the world as we know it into being, so we can forgive his little foibles. The legend 
2 CONC tells that in the ice-laden wastes of NIFLHEIM, he got into a rather catastophic snowball fight with YMIR, the king of the FROST-GIANTS. The Abominable Snowgiant was slashed into pieces and ODIN made 
2 CONC the world from all the bits. He even found a use for the eyebrows. ODIN's dad is BOR, son of BURI, son of an ice cube. Married to FRIGG (with the occasional Freya fling and flirtation with RIND),

2 CONC This may have deep symbolic importance, or perhaps they just felt like it. Because there was no-one around to tell them any better, they may also have evolved into baboons at some point. The legends 
2 CONC tell how the OGDOAD got together and built a little island in the middle of Chaos. Not the most scenic of spots but real estate was limited in those days. A Cosmic Egg was placed on this island and Sun

1 NOTE Also known as OSSIANOISIN: Rip Van Winkle God of Amnesia and Passing Time. Son of the Fenian Hero FINN-MACCOOL and a Goddess called SADB, who Finn ran across when she was a deer. The circumstances become 
2 CONC increasingly bizarre. SADB was abducted by persons unknown whilst pregnant. FINN-MACCOOL ran across a small boy when out with his hounds one day, not realising it was his son OISIN. Finn was a great 
2 CONC one for cross-country running into strange situations with dogged persistence. It now turns out that SADB had been the granddaughter of DAGDA, making OGMA, God of Eloquence, an uncle of OISIN. What 
2 CONC with Finn having eaten the FINTAN, the Salmon of Knowledge, without seemingly having digested it, all the eloquence and wisdom got passed to OISIN who became top poet, songwriter and sensational lyre-plucker. 
2 CONC Then OISIN met NIAMH, a daughter of MANANNAN-MACLIR (how many daughters does this God have?) as she came trotting up on her steed with the golden mane and silver hooves. To his delight she invited 
2 CONC him for a ride to "The Land of Promise"We don't know what went on there, but it went on for a long time, and OISIN not having been able to send a Postcard home with "having a Lovely Time  see you 
2 CONC all soon' scrawled on it, due to there being no postal service at all, thought he should just nip home to let folks know. NIAMH lent him her magic horse, but warned him he must not get off it, as it 
2 CONC would return without him, and there would be no way back. Back in Ireland, OISIN found he had done a Rip Van Winkle' sort of thing, although he had not done so much sleeping, but you get the general 
2 CONC picture  everyone he had known was either dead or departed. Helping some men to clear a boulder from a track, he slipped off the horse and thud. Then the thudding of hooves and the horse was gone. He 
2 CONC tried to jump up and found that he himself was now incredibly old and frail. It is said he was found and taken to tell his tale to St Patrick, because by now the new-fangled Christianity was claiming 
2 CONC the land.  Entry last modified on 05 July 2004

1 NOTE Also known as OLOFATOLIFAT: Prankster God son of LUGEILAN, he is an eternal pest who won't grow up. He uses lightning flashes to slide down to Earth, and rides back upwards on columns of smoke. Which 
2 CONC usually means he has to set fire to something. He plagues other Gods by upsetting cooking pots and distracting them with stupid tomfoolery  then tries to rape their daughters. When things get too hot 
2 CONC in Heaven, it's out the back window and whizz  back to Earth in a flash. On Earth he fits sharks with teeth, and fixes stings onto scorpions. He encourages ants and termites to gnaw through roof beams 
2 CONC causing houses to collapse. He is always setting fire to thatch, and if things get too hot it's back up to Heaven with the smoke. There is never a dull moment with him around and many humans would rather

1 NAME OLMEC-GODS
1 NOTE mayan mythology
1 NOTE OLMEC-GODS: These are very rare Gods belonging to the civilisation that pre-dated the Maya. Anthropologists for some reason best known to themselves have given them roman numerals, which is all we have 
2 CONC to go on. There are ten of them: God i. A dragonish character with flaming eyebrows, and a good old mix and match of crocodile, jaguar, forked tongue and talons. Seems important and probably did Sun, 
2 CONC Earth and Fertility. God ii. A very young Maize God, as he seems to be an infant with maize growing from a cleft in its head. God iii. A Bird Monster type. Although not like any bird you have ever seen. 
2 CONC He is believed to be connected to chinless dwarfs. How, where, why or who actually believes this is past all human understanding. God iv. Petulant-looking Jaguar Monster type. Could be God of Weather 
2 CONC Forecasting. God v. Whoops. The anthropologists, without a word of apology, haven't bothered. God vi. He just grins, most unpleasantly. God vii. Another dragonish wotsit. God viii. Has a fish face. 
2 CONC God ix. We've been let down again. Nobody there. God x. Disembodied Head, who fits the description were-jaguar. See also ALPHABET-GODS and PALENQUE-TRIAD.  Entry last modified on 04 July 2005

2 CONC for planet Earth were so amazingly ambitious, he prudently decided to delegate the job to someone else. So he summoned OBATALA, handed over the Chicken of Creation and told him to get on with it. This

2 CONC emerged from root holes underneath. We're not sure how they got there, but Creator God NJAMBI probably put them there for safekeeping. The first herd of cattle also came from the tree's root holes, 
2 CONC but according to Herero legend, the lesser animals (and rival tribes!) had to be content with ordinary holes in the ground to crawl out of. Omumborombonga trees are now quite common in Namibia. They 
2 CONC are better known in English as Leadwood trees  because their wood is incredibly heavy. The Herero people still venerate them today. So what happened to the original OMUMBOROMBONGA, the tree that gave

2 CONC was filled with unhappy love affairs, mostly because he couldn't help falling for girls above his station. If you're a king and ORION pays a visit, our advice is to lock up your daughter and call 
2 CONC the police. He's a typical macho hunter type, and he mostly hunts females. (See ARTEMIS.) He may also have been involved in the motor industry at one time. Is he anything to do with safety belts? There

2 CONC right, and they include top names such as BABALU-AYE, ELEGUA, OBATALA, OCHOSI, OGUN, OYA, SHANGO and YEMAYA. There was a time when they conducted a power struggle against OLORUN and tried to persuade 
2 CONC him to abdicate for sixteen years. Unwilling to give up control of the Universe to lesser deities, he offered them a trial period of sixteen days. Within eight days the whole Universe had ground to 
2 CONC a halt. They consulted the oracle ORUNMILA who could give no answer. So they had to eat humble pie, confess they didn't have a clue about running Universes and ask for pardon. Being a really great sort 
2 CONC of God, OLORUN was nice as pie about it, and soon returned the world to order. The ORISHAS became his humble but devoted servants for evermore. If there is a moral to this story we suppose it is: 'Sometimes 
2 CONC it is more cruel to be kind.' The ORISHAS are now highly thought of and are worshipped in places as far away as the Caribbean. See our entry on ORICHAS for the Caribbean slant.  Entry last modified

2 CONC as The Modest One, she's wonderfully delicate and bashful  when she's not consorting with SHANGO, that is. She also does divination with shells and loves to decorate herself with beautiful beads and 
2 CONC such. As our forays into flamboyant costumes seem to lack the feminine touch, let us say she is her very own fashion show. OSHUN has her very own fresh water river, whose gentle twists and turns symbolise

2 CONC and Fertility until he was knocked off by his evil brother SET, who locked his body in a chest and chucked it into the Nile. But nothing's ever that simple when it comes to the Gods, and the chest 
2 CONC was washed up on the shore, stuck in a giant tree, turned into a pillar and relocated to the palace of King Byblos where ISIS, having searched high and low, eventually found it. Cursing his luck, 
2 CONC wicked SET chopped the body into a zillion pieces and scattered them all over Egypt. So poor ISIS had to search all over again, collecting bits and pieces of her dead husband until she had every last 
2 CONC scrap. Then RA took pity on her and sent THOTH and ANUBIS to help put the jigsaw puzzle back together. Luckily there were no pieces missing. Except one. Sometimes small details get overlooked, but they 
2 CONC can be of prime importance. SET in his savage spite ensured there was one piece missing when ISIS came to reconstruct OSIRIS. He had thrown the Willy Of OSIRIS into the Nile, where it had been swallowed 
2 CONC by a fish. But ISIS, summoning all her Godly Reconstruction powers, which were by now formidable, managed to fashion another one. It was made out of gold  and fully functional. (Do not attempt this 
2 CONC at home  battery-operated devices will not suffice.) The reconstructed OSIRIS was mummified for burial; and he looked so fine in his shiny wrappings that ISIS couldn't resist one last fling. As luck 
2 CONC would have it, her charms breathed new life into him and she became pregnant with HORUS. Meanwhile, thanks to his Underworld connections, the resurrected OSIRIS was promoted to Judge of the Dead alongside 
2 CONC MAAT and THOTH. Consequently he now has little time for being non-judgmental. OSIRIS also found a new lease of life as part of the SERAPIS Project, a collaborative religious venture between the

1 NOTE norse mythology
1 NOTE OSTARA: Spring Goddess of Fertility. She has her own festival on 21 March, the Spring Equinox, in which bouncing springy behavior is encouraged. OSTARA was very popular with the Anglo-Saxon pagan brigade 
2 CONC who worshipped her under the name EOSTRE  and kicked off the whole Easter business without a JESUS in sight. If you ever wondered what eggs and bunnies have to do with crucifixion and resurrection, 
2 CONC the answer is: absolutely nothing. OSTARA's sacred animal is a cute wittle wabbit  an obvious symbol of fertility  and the egg is her symbol of fertile purity. So Easter Egg hunts are actually packed 
2 CONC with symbolic meanings of rebirth and renewal. And Elmer Fudd is obviously just a high priest of the Great Easter Bunny. In case you think we're being flippant, recent research suggests that OSTARA 
2 CONC herself was actually invented during a mischievous moment by the Venerable Bede. This well-known monk mentioned her in connection with the pagan festival Eosturmonath in a book written in 750 A.D.  but 
2 CONC extensive research has failed to find a trace of her prior to that. Could he possibly have been fibbing? Rabbits and hares are ubiquitous in mythology. Every culture seems to have a Rabbit God  and 
2 CONC they're nearly always trickster spirits. This, we feel, explains a lot. We also have a terrific theory explaining why stage magicians love doing tricks with eggs and rabbits. Was OSTARA pulled out of

1 NAME PACARI
1 NOTE incan mythology
1 NOTE PACARI: This is the Cave of Refuge from which bottled-up Gods emerged after some unmentionable earlier disaster, probably caused by them in the first place. Accounts are very confused and conflicting 
2 CONC as they were still Gods in shock. The twins PIGUERAO and APOCATEQUIL were there at the time but have always refused to comment. There was no Incan Echo reporter on hand at the time and there is nothing 
2 CONC that can be verified. Recent Godchecking research suggests that PACARI may have been located at the Mayan city Teotihuacan. This was old before even the Mayans showed up, and is full of mysteries. Signs 
2 CONC of fire indicate some earlier disaster, and its Pyramid of the Sun covers a chambered cave which may have been The Place Of Emergence. Were the Gods huddled inside while Teotihuacan burned?  Entry

2 CONC MANCO-CAPAC, he was filled with the desire to create a race of humans. But his attempts at people-making were short-lived as he forgot to provide food and had to face a charge of neglect from the starving 
2 CONC masses. His unpopularity was increased further when, in an attempt to rectify the food situation, he turned the First Woman's son into an enormous potato. It was downhill all the way for PACHACAMAC 
2 CONC after that. And then a vengeful VICHAMA turned all his people into rocks, sparing only the potato.  Entry last modified on 07 January 2003

1 NOTE chinese mythology
1 NOTE Also known as P'AN-KUPAN-GU: Giant Creator God born of the Cosmic Egg. In the beginning, the Universe was like a huge black egg floating in the void. (Who laid the egg? We don't know. Our researches have 
2 CONC so far failed to uncover a Cosmic Chicken.) Trapped inside the egg was PAN-GU, by all accounts a hairy, shaggy critter. He had been sleeping for 18,000 years and was now looking forward to stretching 
2 CONC his legs. Grabbing a handy axe, he bashed open the shell and watched in amazement as the Universe formed around him. The light and lissom egg white floated serenely upwards and became the Heavens. 
2 CONC The yolk, being heavier and rather lumpy, plummeted downwards and became the Earth. PAN-GU thought this was wonderful, but what if the Heavens should fall or the Earth rise? The resulting Scrambled Cosmos 
2 CONC was more than he could bear, so he resolved to stand between and hold the two apart like a Chinese ATLAS. Now PAN-GU was a growing lad, becoming taller with each passing year. At the rate of about 
2 CONC three metres per day, after another 18,000 years he'd grown to almost 30,000 kilometres in height. This is roughly the circumference of the Earth, and Heaven was now so far up there was no danger of 
2 CONC it ever falling to Earth again. His mission accomplished, an exhausted PAN-GU expired. His last breath became the wind, his sweat became the rain, his voice became the rumbling of thunder  and the rest 
2 CONC of him was put to equally productive use. Some legends tell that the fleas infesting his shaggy fur dropped to Earth and became the ancestors of the human race. But you can't believe everything you

2 CONC and DEMETER and grew into such a beauty, men would look at her open-mouthed and say 'Cor!' or in Greek 'Kore!'  which is what she came to be called. Although she always insisted her proper name was PERSEPHONE. 
2 CONC With ZEUS and his brother POSEIDON always getting the pick of ravishing beauties, the third brother HADES felt very left out, what with being stuck in the Underworld. So ZEUS promised him a 
2 CONC beautiful woman named Kore when she was old enough. What he neglected to do was let DEMETER or PERSEPHONE know. PERSEPHONE was engaged in the innocent pursuit of picking flowers when a black-horsed chariot 
2 CONC came surging up from a chasm and she was snatched. To all intents and purposes she had vanished without trace. There is an unbreakable bond that those who partake of food in the Underworld are tied 
2 CONC to it forever. HADES, who fancied her rotten, tricked the silly girl into nibbling a few pomegranate seeds. This caused some concentrated arbitration, but ZEUS being the wily old diplomat he was, 
2 CONC brought RHEA into the equation and stitched up an agreement whereby PERSEPHONE could stay with DEMETER for the spring and summer to help with the growth industries and then pop down to live with HADES 
2 CONC for six months or so, creating a winter break and season ticket for nature to take time off. DEMETER's never been happy about this, and that's why winters are so bleak. So think of HADES when you are

2 CONC Wooden boxes float and fishermen catch all manner of odd things in nets  they ended up on a tiny island just big enough to have a king, Olydectus, and all went well. PERSEUS grew up and, being a get-ahead 
2 CONC kind of fellow, set off in a boat to have adventures. Naturally to do this he'd put in a grant for Heavenly Aid. The Stygian NYMPHS provided suitable equipment: a helmet of invisibility from HADES, 
2 CONC a shiny diamond sword from HERMES, and... a scruffy old bag from the tool shed. This last item proved by far the most useful, as he used it to carry off the freshly-severed head of MEDUSA, most notorious 
2 CONC of the GORGONS. From this exploit he gained PEGASUS the Winged Wonder Horse, born from the blood of MEDUSA. (Somewhere along the way he got into an argument with ATLAS and used MEDUSA's head to

1 NAME PI-DISC
1 NOTE chinese mythology
1 NOTE Also known as JADE-PI-DISC, BI-DISC, PI-DISKPI-DISC: These are infinitely precious devices for communicating with Heaven. Jade is most important in Chinese culture. It is the Stone of Heaven. Even in 
2 CONC primitive times it was a rainbow bounty for mankind, who could make sharp axe blades for protection and building without having to go through an Iron Age. In old China, true jade was valued far above 
2 CONC gold or silver. Apart from being rare, beautiful and indestructible (which links it with immortality), it is also of great mystical and spiritual significance. Jade expresses all human virtues, and if 
2 CONC you wish to speak to Heaven you will need a Jade PI-DISC. This is a thick circular piece of jade with a hole bored into its center. Simply hold it to your mouth and speak into it with a suitably devout 
2 CONC tone. Heaven will hear your pleas, and the JADE-EMPEROR himself might answer. Although, knowing how the Chinese Heaven operates, you're more likely to get into an argument with The Heavenly Official 
2 CONC In Charge Of Switchboards. We don't quite know how you receive incoming calls. Presumably you hold the PI-DISC to your ear. As such devices are purest Jade, you would need to be as rich as an Emperor 
2 CONC to own such a thing. And you never see an Emperor listening to anything like that. We have several images of PI-DISCs. Downloading a print, cutting it out and attempting to speak through it will not 
2 CONC get you through to Heaven. But a cardboard PI-DISC is not without its uses. Any disc with a small hole can be used for cheap star-gazing. Chinese astrologers in imperial times used them to peer at stars 
2 CONC and planets using the 'Pinhole Camera' technique  still used today for observing eclipses.   Entry last modified on 11 November 2005

2 CONC a sensual spirit, lusting after angels and stuffing his face with food at every opportunity. Being a good general, his indiscretions were generally overlooked, until one day he guzzled too much peach 
2 CONC wine and misbehaved with CHANG-O, Goddess of the Moon. His drunken advances were very unwelcome to the chaste Goddess. She raised such a fuss that armed guards grabbed the drunken Captain and hauled 
2 CONC him off to the JADE-EMPEROR. Punishment was swift, and the Marshall found himself kicked out of Heaven. Landing on Earth, he discovered he'd been turned into a monstrously ugly pig spirit, complete 
2 CONC with snout, curly tail and boar-like tusks. This was supposed to teach him a lesson. But it didn't work. His lustful nature multiplied and soon he was revelling in troughs and chasing pretty ladies for 
2 CONC all he was worth.  Then along came GUAN-YIN, who offered him salvation  provided he become a Buddhist and help protect the young monk TRIPITAKA. The ex-Marshall of the Heavenly Hosts reluctantly agreed, 
2 CONC and adopted the name of PIGSY. In the company of MONKEY and SANDY, PIGSY travelled to India, carrying TRIPITAKA's baggage and fighting demons along the way. His lustful nature caused many embarrassments, 
2 CONC and he fell pray to many of MONKEY's little jokes. Finally their quest was fulfilled and PIGSY achieved enlightenment. Arriving at Buddhist Heaven, he was rewarded with the title Cleaner of 
2 CONC the Holy Altar. That sounds like a very menial job for an ex-Marshall of the Heavenly Hosts, but as BUDDHA explained, thousands of worshippers send offerings to that altar every day. So now PIGSY gets

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE Also known as PRIAPOSPRIAPUS: Long-standing God of Virility and Fertility. He's the brother of HYMENAEUS and the son of beautiful APHRODITE, but there's some confusion over his father's identity. ZEUS, 
2 CONC APOLLO or DIONYSUS are the most likely candidates. But we incline towards ZEUS because his wife HERA (a jealous rival in the beauty stakes) put a curse on the unborn baby which resulted in him being 
2 CONC delivered plug-ugly and impotent. He was so utterly revolting that the Gods kicked him out and PRIAPUS fell to Earth. The unhappy child was fostered by NYMPHS and shepherds, which brought him during 
2 CONC his formative years into contact with the piping hot band of PAN and the Satyrs, a group well-known for their wild animalistic behaviour and outrageous sexual exhibitionism. He was always well-attended 
2 CONC by NYMPHS and their nymphomania. But sadly, however much PRIAPUS lusted, he could not come up with the goods. Until one day something amazing happened and his male appendage grew to enormous size. Could 
2 CONC there have been a God named Viagra lurking behind the scenes? Unfortunately his erection was permanent, and so huge that he couldn't move. He was rooted to the spot.  Pan carried him off and stood 
2 CONC him at the entrance of the woods as a sort of minder. Whenever unwanted visitors wandered by, Priapus would lift his tunic, brandish his weapon, and scare them away. Following this, statues of PRIAPUS 
2 CONC became very popular for guarding gates, estates, crossroads and doorways. He was employed as a sort of sleeping policeman, or traffic hump. And before passing his figure, it was deemed wise for passers-by 
2 CONC to 'stroke the willy' for luck. (This kind of career opportunity is sadly lacking in modern times.) Somewhere along the line some wag (or graffiti artist) added a winged helmet and sandals to 
2 CONC some of these statues, thereby causing identity confusion with HERMES. Basic phallic statues began to appear and these were known as Herms. (Eventually, the Romans promoted Hermes to MERCURY, so it must 
2 CONC have done his reputation some good!) Meanwhile, PRIAPUS rose fairly high in the public's estimation, and was later given responsibility for harvests and fruitfulness. But the disturbing fact remains, 
2 CONC he never had any progeny. As he was also known as 'Priapus The Pruner', is it possible he had the snip?  Entry last modified on 27 August 2006

2 CONC her crime and having to carry guests on her back. When PWYLL died and PRYDERI came into his inheritance, he was very happy to give his mother in marriage to MANAWYDAN son of LIR. But not for long as 
2 CONC a strange mist came down at the wedding banquet, and when it lifted everything was gone. Estate, animals, folks, crops. All gone. Just empty barren lands. Only PRYDERI, his wife CIGFA, RHIANNON and MANAWYDAN

1 NAME PSYCHE
1 SEX F
1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE PSYCHE: Personification of the Soul, Goddess of Beauty and wife of EROS. Princess PSYCHE was the most amazingly beautiful mortal ever. She was almost as beautiful as APHRODITE with chickenpox on a bad 
2 CONC hair day. People were known to forget their own names and swoon at her feet. Although not usually a malicious Goddess, APHRODITE wanted the princess out of the way. Her temples were being neglected by 
2 CONC PSYCHE fans and it just wasn't on. So she conspired with EROS to make the princess fall in love with the ugliest man they could find. That would soon get her out of the public eye. EROS fluttered off 
2 CONC and got ready to launch an Arrow of Love at the innocent PSYCHE. But by chance, he pricked his finger on that very arrow and fell hopelessly in love with her himself. This caused all kinds of problems 
2 CONC for all concerned, and eventually PSYCHE found herself cut off from mortals and Gods alike as APHRODITE's wrath pursued her. She contemplated suicide by drowning, but even the waves refused to take 
2 CONC her. The only way to salvation was by passing APHRODITE's cruel and unusual tests. Forget sorting poppy seeds from lentils before daybreak or grabbing a cup of water from a mountain monster  the ultimate 
2 CONC challenge was this: Go down to the Underworld and steal PERSEPHONE's beauty cream. Her heart quailed, but Princess PSYCHE made her radiant way down the gloomy steps. Seeing the approach of loveliness, 
2 CONC CERBERUS, the ill-tempered Hound of Hell, rolled over like a puppy. One sweetie from her maidenly hand and he was friends for life. And grim CHARON, taking one look at her youthful beauty, blushed 
2 CONC to his boots and gave her free passage. So finally she arrived at the throne room of HADES himself. Now HADES is very proud of his domain, and doesn't tolerate the living turning up. It spoils the 
2 CONC atmosphere of gloom and despair. So he would've killed PSYCHE there and then, but his wife PERSEPHONE saw this was no ordinary interloper and asked why she'd come. As the story unfolded, PERSEPHONE took 
2 CONC pity on PSYCHE and gave her a big jar of her finest beauty cream. HADES sighed and allowed her to return, making a mental note to cancel CERBERUS's doggie chocs for the next hundred years. PSYCHE struggled 
2 CONC back to the land of the living with the jar of beauty cream. What did APHRODITE want with beauty cream anyway? she wondered. It must be something really potent and special. Surely a little dab 
2 CONC on her cheek wouldn't do any harm… So PSYCHE opened the jar, poked her finger inside, and instantly fainted away. It was very powerful beauty cream indeed. In fact it could have transformed MEDUSA, 
2 CONC ugliest of the GORGONS, into a chart-busting sex kitten with the three GRAEAE sisters on backing vocals. PSYCHE was about to wither away under the influence when EROS turned up and whisked her off to 
2 CONC Olympus. With ZEUS's blessing, they were at last married. APHRODITE didn't mind too much as she now had a goodly supply of face cream to play with.  Entry last modified on 12 February 2004

2 CONC and then made SHU and TEFNUT to form the world. Now he sails across the sky in his solar boat.Mankind was made from his tears and if that doesn't make you grateful, just go to Egypt and look at the

2 CONC with the Sky Goddess NUT (who arches backwards across the world and probably symbolises the Milky Way). In the evening he sails through her mouth and then has to battle through her nightmare insides. 
2 CONC Like some computer-devised game, he wends his way through twelve gates at the rate of one per hour without getting zapped by malevolent hideous monsters. And like some end-of-game baddie, the snake 
2 CONC God APEP lies in wait hoping to gobble him up. Once these perils are transversed, he then surfaces via NUT's birth canal to greet the new day. He's not alone in this enterprise  selected top Gods came 
2 CONC along for the thrill of pitting their skills and chilling out in no uncertain manner. THOTH, MAAT, HATHOR, HORUS are the top crew, with ABTU and ANET as early warning system and KHEPRI the dung beetle 
2 CONC as a sort of morning mascot. The night boat is called Mantchet, and there's also a day boat called Semketet, where they probably laze around sunbathing and drinking cocktails as they recount their 
2 CONC night time adventures. Shrouded in the mists of Chaos and speculation of cosmic genealogy, RA may or may not have had parents. NUT is often put forward as his mother, but is most likely due to his habit 
2 CONC of popping out to be reborn after the night shift. However she was the mother of his children: OSIRIS, ISIS, SET and NEPHTHYS. To accomplish this, THOTH had to invent some additional days for the 
2 CONC calendar so she could take the time off. Later in life there were some amalgamations. RA was so much in the spotlight that many Gods tried to get in on the act by adding his name to theirs for added 
2 CONC glory. The most notable of these was AMUN-RA. RA himself seems to have opted for semi-retirement, although he remains very much in the public eye and has a full schedule of guest appearances.  Entry last

2 CONC as REMUS immediately crossed the line which had only been drawn in the dust. So ROMULUS struck him. It was a very bad strike because REMUS fell fatally injured. Undeterred, ROMULUS carried on. When completed

2 CONC and Sabines, and Rome grew. ROMULUS made himself king and ruled for 33 years until he was carried off to Heaven by MARS during a solar eclipse to become a deity called QUIRINUS. Or did he? Another version 
2 CONC said he was nothing but a self-seeking scumbag and he was torn to bits in secret by senators and the remains and stains carefully obliterated. 'Romulus? Um, we think he's gone on holiday  there's

2 CONC of Heavenly banners and ceremonial drapes. One day he accidentally broke the JADE-EMPEROR's favorite crystal dish. As punishment, he was chucked out of Heaven, transformed into an Earth-bound fish spirit,

2 CONC in the River of Sands by munching the flesh of the occasional passing peasant. He became morose, philosophical and a frightful pessimist. A chance to redeem himself came when GUAN-YIN, looking for heroic 
2 CONC candidates to assist TRIPITAKA, persuaded him to become a Buddhist. He embraced the faith and adopted the name Sandy Monk. Then it was adventures all the way to India in the company of MONKEY and 
2 CONC PIGSY. SANDY's special jobs were leading the horse, which he did with much devotion, and fighting demons, which he did with much complaint. When at last the quest was over, he achieved enlightenment

1 NAME SATAN
1 SEX M
1 NOTE middle-eastern mythology
1 NOTE Also known as DEVIL, PRINCE-OF-DARKNESS, HA-SATAN, ACCUSER, DIABOLOS, OLD-NICK, STANSATAN: The Devil  Mr All-round Evil Genius and the Adversary of GOD  particularly the Christian variety JEHOVAH. A rebel 
2 CONC angel, he was originally the team leader of the spiritual world, possessing great power and responsibility. But he turned nasty and tried to set himself up as a rival to GOD. As a punishment for 
2 CONC his rebellious pride, he was cast out of Heaven, along with a rabble of other rebels. Now SATAN rules the infernal regions of Hell, with an army of demons to do his bidding. Out of pure malice and vengeance, 
2 CONC he aims to overthrow the established order by turning humans against GOD. Using every trick in the book, he spreads evil whispers, plants the seeds of doubt, and tempts the unwary to fall from 
2 CONC grace. SATAN relishes his role of troublemaker and tempter. And let's face it, he's pretty good at his job. No wonder JESUS called him the Prince of this World. What does SATAN look like? Answer: anything 
2 CONC he likes. According to legend, his appearance ranges from the demonic to the smart. He can have the traditional horns, scales, a forked tail, the head of a goat, cloven feet  or turn up as a smooth 
2 CONC dude in the latest Italian suit. But there's always more to him than meets the eye; his own eyes can glow like red-hot coals. As with most things in Christianity, older legends and rival religions 
2 CONC had a strong influence on the concept of SATAN. The Persian baddie AHRIMAN was sucked in  and popular Gods such as BAAL were twisted into evil versions such as BEELZEBUB. This also happened with PAN, 
2 CONC a very popular God whose sexual antics horrified the Church so much that they labelled him the Devil. That is why SATAN has goat's legs and horns. If PAN could sue for libel the Church wouldn't have 
2 CONC a leg to stand on. Because the Old Testament has little to say on the subject of SATAN, the early Christians were free to speculate as they formulated their new theology. What wasn't already present in 
2 CONC Jewish tradition they could plunder from elsewhere or downright invent. This was especially popular in medieval times, when cataloging the attributes of demons and angels was virtually a career. You 
2 CONC could almost get a government research grant for it. Case in point: SATAN is also known as LUCIFER. Why? Lucifer is a Latin word meaning Light-Bearer. St JEROME (4th Century) used it to denote the Greek 
2 CONC word Heosphoros when he was translating the Bible into Latin. But Heosphoros means 'morning star', and the Biblical passage in question (Isaiah 14) is really just taunting the King of Babylon. ("You 
2 CONC think you're as bright as Venus, but God's gonna get ya!") Still, the name stuck and legends of Lucifer sprang up all over. From Light-Bearer to Prince of Darkness. Poor old VENUS should sue for libel 
2 CONC too. SATAN seems to inspire an eerie fascination and turns up in the most unlikely places. In his devilish guise he leaves bits of himself all over the landscape. Devil's Elbow, Devil's Footprints, 
2 CONC Devil's Hollow, Devil's Chimney, Devil's Dyke... We think he just likes to be noticed.   Entry last modified on 27 August 2006

1 NOTE Also known as SATURNSATURNUS: Ancient Agricultural God of Sowing Seeds, later promoted to deity in charge of Carnivals and Free Festivals. He originally started out as a primeval deity in charge of crops. 
2 CONC But as Greek culture spread its influence over Roman thought, SATURNUS slowly began to take on the attributes of CRONUS the Titan. He just couldn't help it. One of these attributes was the nasty 
2 CONC habit of eating his own children. SATURNUS  presumably having read up on the Greek Myths  was terrified that his kids would overthrow him. He therefore began to devour them, although not without some 
2 CONC reluctance and guilt. Needless to say, one child was hidden from the gaping maw of his dad and survived. Little JUPITER did indeed become the Master of the Universe instead of his father. But SATURNUS 
2 CONC was not overthrown; he was given a pardon in appreciation for his tireless work running the world and organising the crops in the idyllic Golden Age before the Greeks came along to mess it all up. Being 
2 CONC Roman, it was any excuse for a festival and his Saturnalia Carnival came to dominate the calendar. This festival celebrated the Winter Solstice and all the normal rules of life were turned upside-down 
2 CONC for a week. Bosses and slaves changed places, rudeness and lewdness were encouraged, and much fun was had by everybody. It's nice to be able to report a happy ending. And the fun still goes on. As 
2 CONC all pagans know, the climax of Saturnalian feasting and pleasure is December 25th. Never mind Santa Claus  it's SATURNUS who should be the God of Office Christmas Parties.  Entry last modified on 08

2 CONC in the very earliest days of China (2800 B.C.). Announcing himself 'Lord of the Burning Wind', his slash-and-burn policy of clearing scrublands left the ground rich in potash ready for ploughing and planting. 
2 CONC He then taught his fellow mortals how to farm, and became known as the Holy Ploughman King. But he's best known for his knowledge of herbs, drugs and medicine. He single-handedly tasted each 
2 CONC and every plant in China to see what was yummy and what would kill you. Legend tells that during his research he was once poisoned no less than seventy-two times in a single day. Amazingly, he suffered 
2 CONC no long-term ill effects. Perhaps the medicinal plants and poisonous plants cancelled each other out. Apart from that, he has a transparent stomach, which did come in very handy for seeing what all 
2 CONC those plants were doing to his insides. He also has a head of oxen. Does that mean he had an ox's head or that he drove oxen? Or even that he drank Oxo? It is all very garbled. He married SIEN-TSANG, 
2 CONC possibly had a son called QI-YU, and then the computer crashed and lost all our notes. We shall return in due course.  Entry last modified on 15 April 2004

1 NOTE Also known as SHOU-HSING, SHOU-LAO, NAN-JI-XIAN-WENGSHOU-XING: God of Longevity and Old Age, and the most venerable member of the SAN-XING happiness squad. His name means 'Star Of Long Life'. He is old 
2 CONC and bald, and always carries a Golden Peach of Immortality from XI-WANGMU's Holy Peach Garden. These are found only in Heaven and ripen once every three thousand years. Ironically he didn't actually 
2 CONC get to eat one. His long life came about by quite different means. Once he was a young and sickly lad named Zhao-Yen, who was destined to die when he reached 19. Told by a fortune-teller to enter a certain 
2 CONC field armed with a packed lunch, he found two men playing checkers. Having been warned to keep his mouth shut, he silently offered them spring rolls and wine, which were gratefully accepted. So 
2 CONC gratefully, in fact, that the men, revealing themselves to be the Gods of Birth and Death, offered him longevity. First they took his allotted lifespan of 19 years and reversed it, giving 91 years. Then 
2 CONC they munched another spring roll, had another sip of wine, and decided he deserved immortality. That must have been a very impressive packed lunch.  Entry last modified on 04 August 2005

1 NOTE Also known as SUSHU: Primeval God of Air, along with his twin sister TEFNUT. He deals in the dry dusty variety, while she's more than a little damp. At least they didn't have air guitars to contend with. 
2 CONC SHU is the son of ATUM and fathered NUT (the Sky), and GEB (the Earth), with a little help from TEFNUT. But things didn't quite go according to plan. The Sky wouldn't stay put and kept falling down 
2 CONC onto the Earth. As gravity hadn't yet been invented, SHU decided there must be another reason. And there was. NUT and GEB were passionately in love and sneaking tight embraces at every opportunity. 
2 CONC It wasn't so much a case of "Did the Earth move for you?" as "Did the sky fall on top of you last night?" SHU put a stop to all this, but not before NUT had given birth to some very important new Gods. 
2 CONC And now SHU stands between NUT and GEB, holding up the sky like an Egyptian ATLAS.  Entry last modified on 27 August 2006

2 CONC was not a God to be ripped off and when she looked at the Immortality Contract she found the clause: 'Youth and Beauty not included'. After a few hundred years she was a tiny wrinkly little thing. 
2 CONC The priests hung her on the wall in a bottle and charged extra to see the talking curio. By this time the only words she would come out with were: "I want to die". This may not be the end of the story,

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE SIBYLS: Females blessed with the Gift of Prophecy and Second-Sight. Sometimes even Third-Sight. According to the Oracle, SIBYLS is the plural of Sibyl. There weren't many of them, but they were a singular 
2 CONC lot. SIBYLS were fortune tellers. Girls who chewed laurel leaves and other funny substances, spouting strange gibberish which was alleged to be the words of the Gods. They started off in the Greek 
2 CONC world but were still going strong in Roman times. See, for example, ALBUNEA, SIBYL-OF-CUMAE(2). For a small consideration plus service charge, priests would translate these into prophecies. Much more 
2 CONC fun than Horoscopes and extremely popular. However, life as a prophetess was not a lot of fun. See, for example, the SIBYL-OF-CUMAE. Not to mention CASSANDRA.  Entry last modified on 27 August 2006

2 CONC island. When a rare ship is sighted, they sing their hearts out hoping that DEMETER will hear them and take pity. She never does, and when the sailors draw nearer to listen, and the first sailor 
2 CONC says "I don't fancy your bird" or "Look at the claws on that" the SIRENS forget any semblance of maidenly manners and the phrase 'going for a song' takes on a new meaning of unbridled savagery. Besides,

2 CONC it did. The package, unlike PANDORA's box, contained only goodies, but goodies in such overflowing abundance soon there was no room on the boat. Soon there was no boat as it was sinking under the weight

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE SISYPHUS: Son of AEOLUS, he was a rogue too far. A swindling cattle dealer who raped and pillaged his way to a kingdom. His very name means 'too clever', which he was by more than half. Even AUTOLYCUS 
2 CONC failed to outwit him. He did nasty things to people with stones, not throwing, but piling on top and crushing. The end came when he upset ZEUS by disclosing his whereabouts for a reward while ZEUS was 
2 CONC up to his naughties. ZEUS got in touch with his brother HADES and they agreed it was time SISYPHUS got his come-uppance, or in this instance go-downance. When HADES came to take him into protective 
2 CONC custody, SISYPHUS feigned such interest in the knots HADES had used to tie his wrists that HADES offered him an action replay demonstration. Before you could say 'SISYPHUS is a smart ass', it was HADES 
2 CONC who was bound and taken to a dungeon. With HADES out of action nobody could die, which upset ARES because it took all the fun out of battles. So ARES found and released HADES and they set out to nab 
2 CONC SISYPHUS, who just had time to yell to his wife not to bury any body he forced to leave behind. Reaching the Underworld, SISYPHUS kicked up a mighty fuss with PERSEPHONE, claiming he was still alive 
2 CONC because he'd not had a funeral yet. He asked for three days compassionate leave to sort things out and she concurred. Naturally he did not return. ZEUS sent HERMES to sort him out. HERMES put him in a 
2 CONC neck hold and dragged him off, ignoring pleas, cajolery, questions or anything else. No messing this time. For being such a troublemaker SISYPHUS was given hard labor involving rolling a boulder up to 
2 CONC the top of a hill. "Just roll it up to the top and let it go down the other side and you're out of here." But of course it never happens. Every time SISYPHUS gets to the top the boulder slips and rolls 
2 CONC back down again. Better luck next time after time after time…  Entry last modified on 12 February 2004

1 NOTE japanese mythology
1 NOTE SUSANOO: God of the Ocean. Being born from the snot of IZANAGI was not an auspicious start to life and could be the reason SUSANOO was prone to behaving like a bit of a bogey  especially towards his sister 
2 CONC AMATERASU. She was born from the left eye of IZANAGI presumably after wiping a tear away after sneezing. He had just come back from the Underworld and was covered in gloom dust. Another God, TSUKIYOMI, 
2 CONC was born from a tear in his right eye. AMATERASU was given the sun and TSUKIYOMI was given the moon and SUSANOO was given the ocean, which he rejected. He then argued with his sister saying the 
2 CONC one that could produce the most godlets instantly should have the most power. He snatched her fertility beads, bit them open and spat out five godlings, shouting 'I've won. AMATERASU counter claimed 
2 CONC saying as the beads belonged to her so did the godlets. This caused SUSANOO to have endless tantrums, rushing about the world and throwing things all over the place. He ended up by throwing a flayed 
2 CONC horse through the roof of AMATERASU's Sewing Room which scared the daylights out of her so she ran away and hid in a cave which caused no end of commotion as the sun couldn't shine again until she was 
2 CONC coaxed out. SUSANOO was then thrown out of heaven and mooched about earth rather at a loss until he met an old couple weeping copiously. 'What's up?' he asked, and they told him they were due to be visited 
2 CONC by an eight-headed dragon. He had already eaten seven of their daughters and now he was coming to scoff the very last one. When SUSANOO saw the daughter he realized what was missing in his life, 
2 CONC and said 'Give your daughter to me  I'll look after her don't you worry  now tell me about this dragon and have you got any booze?'. SUSANOO changed the girl into a comb, as he still retained some godly 
2 CONC powers, and stuck her into his hair to keep her out of harm's way and then filled eight bowls with rice wine inside a palisade he built which had eight holes in it. The dragon came sniffing along 
2 CONC its usual route, came across the neatly concealed wine and thought this is my day. Eight heads popped through the holes, eight tongues lapped, eight brains became befuddled and the whole dragon conurbation 
2 CONC fell into a slumber. Enter SUSANOO with a sword, and a swish, and a lop and a chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop. Just for good measure he gave a few extra strokes to the body and something 
2 CONC dropped out of the dragon's tail with a clung it turned out to be a sword. The sword is called KUSANAGI and supplies proof to all you skeptics that this tale must be absolutely true as this is the 
2 CONC Imperial Sword of the Japanese Royal Family and may be viewed today providing you can get the necessary permission. And SUSANOO? From then on he always kept his nose clean.  Entry last modified on 04

2 CONC has he succumbed to Walt Disneyfication? Maybe we've got our lines tangled as other accounts make him responsible for everything colored red. But he may also be TA-ARDA, TAGARO or TANGALOA, or not,

1 NAME TANGATA-MANU
1 SEX M
1 NOTE oceanic mythology
1 NOTE Also known as BIRD-MAN, TANGATAMANUTANGATA-MANU: The Bird-Man deity of Easter Island, and Earthly representative of MAKE-MAKE. A thousand years ago, the Rapanui people were quite content to worship their 
2 CONC ancestors, pay homage to MAKE-MAKE and build rather a lot of huge MOAI statues. But due to greed and a complete lack of ecological savvy, the flourishing forests were destroyed, the land was over-farmed, 
2 CONC and Easter Island became a pretty tough place to live. There were two factions at the time, the Fat Ones and the Thin Ones. No-one knows for sure, but it seems that the Fat Ones owned all the 
2 CONC juicy bits of land while the Thin Ones toiled and scratched. Result: revolution. The Thin Ones rose up, slaughtered their rivals, threw down the MOAI, and adopted a brand new deity. The cult of TANGATA-MANU 
2 CONC was born and statue-building was abandoned overnight, leaving a graveyard of unfinished MOAI to puzzle future archeologists.  TANGATA-MANU the Bird-Man was supposed to be MAKE-MAKE's Earthly ambassador, 
2 CONC but he didn't object to a bit of devout fun. Thus began the Great Easter Island Egg Hunt, a yearly sporting event in which daring lads would scramble over cliffs and rocks in search of the first 
2 CONC egg of the season. This was quite a dangerous mission, and whoever found and returned the egg safely was showered with praise and crowned Bird Man of the Year. TANGATA-MANU himself is somewhat elusive. 
2 CONC There are many carvings of him bending over an egg and looking at it in a rather perplexed manner. We don't know what to make of it either.  Entry last modified on 05 December 2004

2 CONC pregnant hippopotamus. If you can believe this, just add breasts and a crocodile tail. (Make that several breasts  she was very well-endowed in that department.) Possibly the wife of SEBEK, she protects 
2 CONC women and children. Her alternative name Thoeris appears to mean 'Mistress of Talismans'. For added protection during maternity, put a picture of her on your pillow to keep the demons away. According

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE THESEUS: King of Athens, Hero of a thousand exploits, best buddies with HERACLES, and all-round Greek top guy. His very name became a byword and advertising slogan: 'Nothing Without Theseus!' The son 
2 CONC of Aethra and Aegeus, his mother was a one night fling with King Aegeus, including drink and POSEIDON on the holiday visiting list. So when THESEUS was born in Troezen his mum was a single parent. When 
2 CONC he was old enough to ask questions his mother told him the answer lay under a rock when he was big enough to lift it. It took him to the age of 16. And underneath was a pair of sandals and a sword belonging 
2 CONC to his unknown father. The boy decided to pay his father a visit when  his mother finally admitted "He's the King of Athens".  This was far enough away for the lad to have many breathtaking heroic 
2 CONC adventures en route. By the time he reached Athens his heroic reputation had preceded him and he was invited to the palace for a feast. He wasn't too sure about the etiquette or if indeed the King 
2 CONC was really his father. The Queen however was MEDEA the witch. She knew THESEUS straight away and could sense competition with her own son Medi who she had in line as heir to the throne. So it was poison 
2 CONC in the wine cup for the guest. The plot was foiled by a great gasp from the King who recognised as his own the sword THESEUS was wearing. "My Son!" he cried, and hugs of delight meant the wine went 
2 CONC every which way but down. Very soon afterwards MEDEA took one of her hasty exits plus son. The King was delighted with his new heir. There was naturally some opposition by other relatives with high 
2 CONC hopes. Notably the fifty sons of King PALLAS(5). THESEUS had to wipe out the lot of them. Then there was trouble with King MINOS and the MINOTAUR. The King fretted as THESEUS set off happily with a 
2 CONC boatload of sacrificial victims to sort it all out. Which of course he did with the aid of ARIADNE and a ball of string. Amazing stuff. There were slight oversights on his return; he left ARIADNE on a 
2 CONC beach somewhere, and forgot the to change the tatty black sails of doom for the white sails of victory as pre-arranged, causing his dear old dad to leap into the sea with sorrow and not come up. THESEUS, 
2 CONC now King of Athens, found life a bit boring. He needed his fix of ripping yarn adventuring. He fought the Amazons and captured ANTIOPE and with her had a son called HIPPOLYTUS. But it was Phaedra, 
2 CONC another daughter of King MINOS, that he married. Not a good choice  when THESEUS was away she tried to seduce her stepson causing troubles all round. HIPPOLYTUS was killed in a chariot crash, Phaedra 
2 CONC hung herself and the Gods were most upset. Then ANTIOPE turned up with a bunch a Amazons to duff up THESEUS because of her son's death, and she got killed in the scrimmage. It was all too much for THESEUS 
2 CONC and he took off with some unsavory characters into kidnapping ventures. First they stole a young HELEN from Sparta then embarked on a crazy plan to abduct PERSEPHONE from HADES. They sweet-talked 
2 CONC their way into the Underworld and HADES invited them to dine, but he was not fooled and the seating arrangements included the Stone Thrones of Forgetfulness. These hold you fast, and slowly you fuse 
2 CONC into the very structure. HERACLES on his visit to take CERBERUS for a walk came across them and attempted a rescue, but only THESEUS hobbled back into daylight minus portions of his legs. Back in Athens 
2 CONC no-one recognised the battered hero and he was sent on his way as a beggar. He ended up in Scyros and ARTEMIS arranged for him to be slung off a cliff because of the way he had treated ANTIOPE. End 
2 CONC of story? Not quite. His ghost came to help the Athenians against the Persians in 490 BC. After which his bones were found via an Oracle, together with the golden sword. These were brought back to 
2 CONC Athens as protective symbols. As they say, Nothing Without Theseus!  Entry last modified on 06 December 2004

2 CONC ever a God was greater than great it was THOTH. In one translation his name is prefixed with the word 'great' no less than eight times. Thith may have helped to reduce the embarrathment cauthed by having

2 CONC degrees? Thank THOTH. His bestselling BOOK-OF-THE-DEAD is still in print and you will never be able to hitch-hike to Heaven on the Nile without it. He does have his eccentricities  he sometimes likes 
2 CONC to revert back to the good old OGDOAD days and appear as a baboon. Not just any old baboon, but one that could have written the complete works of Shakespeare before Shakespeare existed. (Now there's 
2 CONC an idea  it's always been known that Shakespeare could hardly write his own name let alone spell it, so who really wrote all those plays that bearded scene-shifter claimed as his own?) In the custom of 
2 CONC the times he chose the head of an Ibis with a fancy wig for those high-flying occasions. Encouraging RA to call himself Top God left THOTH free to run just about everything without any fuss or hassle. 
2 CONC Pocket calculators? THOTH used the whole firmament, available to all on a grand scale. Think Sky. To make it easier, all the stars and planets required for calculation are associated with favourite 
2 CONC Gods. Need to work something out via Sirius? Log in and have HATHOR guide you. Need the moon for phases, time or tides? Go to THOTH; he chose to be Top Moon God alongside his best buddy KHONSU. Cool, 
2 CONC modest, unflappable, and a brilliant arbitrator, THOTH has stood the test of time, time and time again. Full ticks and tocks to this tip-top God. He was also known to Greek God geeks as Hermes Trismegistus,

1 NAME TRIPITAKA
1 SEX M
1 NOTE chinese mythology
1 NOTE Also known as XUAN-ZANG, SAN-ZANG, HSUAN-TSANGTRIPITAKA: The famous Tang Dynasty Buddhist monk who travelled to India to fetch scriptures in the company of MONKEY, PIGSY and SANDY. Although Buddhism had 
2 CONC achieved a foothold in China, knowledge of its more profound mysteries was scarce. The minor (Little Vehicle) Scriptures were constantly consulted, but these were pretty tame and hardly anything to 
2 CONC get excited about. Only the Big Vehicle Scriptures could truly save the damned. BUDDHA was well aware of this little problem, and asked GUAN-YIN to help. "I have three full baskets of Scripture on Earth, 
2 CONC waiting at the Temple of the Thunderclap for someone to collect them," he said. "Could you find a pilgrim to travel the hundred thousand leagues from China to India and back?" "Of course," he mused 
2 CONC thoughtfully, "I could just transport them there myself in an instant, but the Chinese people just wouldn't appreciate it." So GUAN-YIN travelled down to Earth, looking for a humble and pious Chinese 
2 CONC monk. Preferably one with stout legs. And a young priest named Xuan Zang seemed to fit the bill perfectly, so with a modest display of holy fireworks, GUAN-YIN persuaded the Emperor to send him on 
2 CONC the quest. In honor of his mission, Xuan adopted the name TRIPITAKA (which means 'Three Baskets' in Sanskrit). And off he went on the dangerous and incredibly long journey to India, taking only a horse, 
2 CONC a change of underwear and a golden begging bowl. Now TRIPITAKA, being young and foolish, was probably the least likely hero imaginable. When faced with danger he was liable to fiddle with joss sticks 
2 CONC and burst into tears. Luckily GUAN-YIN had provided backup in the form of MONKEY, PIGSY and SANDY. They were not a well-knit team, and argued constantly, but in the course of time TRIPITAKA's disciples 
2 CONC became used to his silly human ways and fought tooth and nail to protect him. The four travellers (plus horse) negotiated their way through eighty-one disasters and many exciting adventures before 
2 CONC arriving, many years later, at the Temple of the Thunderclap. Achieving enlightenment, TRIPITAKA passed into Buddhist Heaven with much ceremonial hoo-hah and prepared to fulfill his mission. So he was 
2 CONC somewhat disconcerted when ANANDA and KASYAPA tried to fob him off with blank scrolls. BUDDHA was somewhat peeved. "Such knowledge is infinitely precious, and not to be given away lightly. Everything 
2 CONC has its price, even in Heaven," he said. "Give them your golden begging bowl as payment and we'll call it a deal. Although," he added, "to be perfectly honest, those blank scrolls are actually far 
2 CONC more illuminating than the real ones." Convincing BUDDHA that the Chinese people would much prefer scriptures with writing on, TRIPITAKA handed over his bowl, collected five thousand and forty-eight precious 
2 CONC scrolls and headed back to China, taking the illuminated Buddhist Express which got him there in double-quick time. And so at last his mission was fulfilled. He now takes his place in Buddhist 
2 CONC Heaven and is known as the 'Buddha of Precocious Merit'.  Entry last modified on 29 August 2006

2 CONC he had a hundred dragon heads with flame-flashing eyes. He liked to spit molten rock, and his snake arms and legs were too numerous and writhy to check out. He scared the hell out of the Gods, who 
2 CONC fled from Olympus and hid out in Egypt. When ZEUS could no longer take the 'cowardy custard' jibes of ATHENA, he was forced to fight. And got his ass badly whipped. TYPHON then took the badly battered 
2 CONC God off to his cave to tear him to bits at leisure. He started by hacking out a few sinews so ZEUS could not move. TYPHON then took a few days off to go clubbing and left a monsteress called DELPHYNE

2 CONC in and hurriedly popped ZEUS's sinews back into what he hoped were the right places, leaving the healing process to immortality  which is pretty foolproof and almost instantaneous. After all the humiliation, 
2 CONC ZEUS was more than somewhat peeved. The return fight was on in almost no time. It would have been a sell-out if the Gods had bothered about such stupid things as money. ZEUS trained hard, and 
2 CONC various supporters of his plied TYPHON with drink... Wham! Bam! Bam! Slam! This was one of the ding-dongs of all time. No blows barred. Forget the Rocky films  this was a battle with real rocks. Not

2 CONC don't have a right hand? About TYR's only legacy now is that Tuesday is named after him. What he did on Tuesday we're not quite sure. Perhaps it was his day off. TYR is shrouded in a great deal of mystery, 
2 CONC speculation and rumor. He might be older than ODIN or even ODIN's son, and may once have been a wooden pillar that supported the Universe. TYR could also have Celtic connections, putting himself 
2 CONC about as NUADA of the Silver Hand with claims to have lost his hand in battle. The Germans or Teutons, who lost no opportunity to invade Mythology, called him Ziu or Tiuz, which could of course cause 
2 CONC confusion with ZEUS. They also called him Things, from which the German word for Tuesday (Dienstag) is derived. He has even been associated with Mars, probably by the U.F.O. tribe. The only certified 
2 CONC documentation that can be produced is via the Norse Legends, but how often do Gods get asked to produce a passport? Anyway, TYR is waiting for his revenge on the wolf FENRIR during RAGNAROK (he won't 
2 CONC get it). Then again, RAGNAROK may already have happened, in which case TYR will have killed GARM the Monster Hound belonging to HEL.  Entry last modified on 29 August 2006

2 CONC Because they can grab any warrior they fancy, and take him away. There is only one rule; the bewildered chump or champion must be dead first. So you must fight for your life, because if you fail you 
2 CONC could be scooped up by one of the delighted long-legged VALKYRIES with flowing blonde hair and borne off to VALHALLA the Hero's Heaven. There you will be forced to feast, force down gallons of mead,

2 CONC He was very very old with no teeth even when he was first worshipped, which was so long ago it may have been before time began. We don't know how black he is either. His face may be painted black, or 
2 CONC he might just have been cleaning the chimney or living in a cave for too long. But perhaps it's the fumes from the potent black cigars he smokes. If you like the good old days and haven't yet given up 
2 CONC smoking, VOTAN could be the God for you. He's also known as God L. L is for Live Percussion! Yes, VOTAN is the God of Drums! He invented the art of drum solos in his skin-tight and drumboogie days.

2 CONC the Earth wasn't quite finished, so he buried the man in a homemade coffin to keep him safe while he added the finishing touches with fire and brimstone. The process took seven long years, and the man 
2 CONC was so bored at the end of it all that WAAQA created a woman to keep him company. This certainly gave him something to do, and the result was thirty children. The man was a bit embarrassed by all this 
2 CONC activity and tried to hide some of his kids, but WAAQA in his wisdom turned them into animals instead. Untouched by missionary zeal, WAAQA is still a Top God today. He is supreme. He is omnipotent. 
2 CONC He is monotheistic. He rules over all. His will is unshakeable and unbreakable. He rewards the good and punishes the bad. And he likes a great deal of attention. In other words, WAAQA is exactly like 
2 CONC every other monotheistic deity we know of. He is worshipped devoutly and frequently by his followers, and there is little else to tell. Oh, except that WAAQA and his people have often been the target 
2 CONC of missionaries and religious fundamentalists claiming: a) that WAAQA is ALLAH and should be worshipped as such b) that WAAQA is JEHOVAH and should be worshipped as such c) that WAAQA really is JEHOVAH,

1 NAME YAHWEH
1 SEX M
1 NOTE middle-eastern mythology
1 NOTE Also known as JAHWEHYAHWEH: The one and only GOD of the Old Testament  the God of Abraham, Moses and Job unto the nth generation. In the beginning, YAHWEH created the Heavens and the Earth. It only took 
2 CONC him six days with no hired help. He also found the time to include incontrovertible evidence of a Big Bang, presumably to annoy future cosmologists. On the seventh day he rested. On the eighth day 
2 CONC he went back to work as there was trouble in Paradise. Having created Mankind in his own image, YAHWEH soon discovered that this was no guarantee of quality. ADAM had eaten from the Tree of Knowledge 
2 CONC and infected his descendents with a virulent strain of independence  a plague worse than Ebola. Humans were rampantly disobeying orders and running amok. There had obviously been a cock-up in the morality 
2 CONC department. So YAHWEH decided in his wisdom to drown everyone on the planet. 'Humans are far too corrupt. Let's wash them all away and start again!' The Earth was consumed by floods and all life 
2 CONC was wiped out. Only the righteous NOAH and his family survived to repopulate the world. But having made a clean sweep of humanity, YAHWEH was disappointed to find that the remaining few were as naughty 
2 CONC as ever. Even NOAH liked to get drunk and get naked now and again (Genesis 9:20-21). YAHWEH was most displeased. In fact he seems to have taken it personally. He was now a God with a grudge. His jealous 
2 CONC wrath knew no bounds. Whenever those naughty humans began to reap the rewards of a hard-won civilisation, POW!, they'd be zapped to oblivion. Meanwhile he clung to the few God-fearing folk he could 
2 CONC find. Most of these were the descendents of Jacob aka Israel, and had unfortunately been sold into Egyptian slavery. Enter MOSES, who was somewhat unwillingly cast as Ringleader and Godly Go-between. 
2 CONC YAHWEH grabbed his attention with a burning bush, divulged his sacred name YHWH, and then proceeded to issue an entire Pentateuch of instructions. This time God was going to get a little respect. A 
2 CONC series of spectacular miracles terrified everyone into submission, and a triumphant MOSES led the Israelites out of bondage and into the desert for forty years of subsistence freedom. Although he'd promised 
2 CONC them a land of their own, YAHWEH was now God of a wandering people who spent much of their time arguing, grumbling, moaning, complaining and bitching. To keep the peace, MOSES was issued with 
2 CONC the Ten Thousand Commandments, although decrees such as: "Thou shalt not clip off the edges of your beard" never made it into the Top Ten. But still the people squabbled; they didn't want some aloof invisible 
2 CONC God bossing them around, they wanted a tangible deity they could look at and brush the flies off. In desperation, some of them started worshipping sheep and lumps of rock. MOSES was livid, but 
2 CONC YAHWEH in his wisdom knew that the only way to appease his people was to give them what they wanted. So he set their best craftsmen to work constructing a highly complicated and fiddly structure made 
2 CONC of wood, gold, and precious gems. This was the Tabernacle  the world's first portable temple. When it was finished, YAHWEH descended in the form of a fiery cloud and set up shop inside the Holy of Holies. 
2 CONC Of course no-one was allowed to peek inside, but once a year the High Priest was permitted to enter and sprinkle a little sheep's blood around. By now the people had their hands full negotiating 
2 CONC a bewildering range of Burnt Offerings, Sin Offerings, Atonement Offerings, Grain Offerings, Fellowship Offerings and Guilt Offerings. These required the ritual slaughter and burning of various animals 
2 CONC as there was nothing the Lord liked better than the aroma of barbecued goat. After forty years of wandering the desert and lugging God around inside his Tabernacle, the Israelites arrived at Canaan, 
2 CONC the Promised Land. As advertised, it was overflowing with milk and honey  and also existing tenants. The history of how YAHWEH and the Israelites fared in this new land is long and full of exciting 
2 CONC adventures. David versus Goliath. Job versus SATAN. Jonah versus the Whale. Ezekial versus the Flying Saucers. But this entry is far too long already. Go read the Old Testament for yourself. Suffice 
2 CONC to say that YAHWEH spent endless hours testing his people's obedience, and they in turn tested his patience to the limit. Rules and regulations expanded in all directions, the High Priests evolved into 
2 CONC a stilted bureacracy of ritual, and what with one invasion or another, the Jewish people ended up pretty much how they'd started: under foreign rule and hoping for a Chosen One to lead them out of the 
2 CONC darkness. And then along came JESUS...  Entry last modified on 22 July 2005

2 CONC King of the First Court of Hell, but Heaven accused him of undue leniency. Far too many souls were crossing the Golden Bridge to Heaven and the place was getting crowded. To prevent spiritual overpopulation,

2 CONC and joy, she departs. All seems serene but nothing is ever quite perfect. YHI was not very good at anatomy. Most of her creations had no means of locomotion. No legs, no feet, no wings. They just couldn't 
2 CONC get about. YHI had not planned a return trip, but Earthly pleas reached her ears, and what is such a darling Goddess to do? Her best of course! So back she came and added legs and wings and fins 
2 CONC and things. But her anatomy is still far from brilliant which is why you have such weird and wonderful wildlife in Australia. Think duckbilled platypus and kangaroo. There was also a strange thing called

1 SEX M
1 NOTE middle-eastern mythology
1 NOTE Also known as JHVH, JHWH, YHVH, YHVH, TETRAGRAMMATON, HA-SHEMYHWH: The Official and Unspeakably Sacred Name of GOD in Judaism and Christianity. When MOSES was confronted by YAHWEH on the mountainside, 
2 CONC he was understandably curious. It's not every day the Creator of the Universe pays you a visit. But YAHWEH was more interested in revealing his Israelite Master Plan than answering a bunch of silly questions. 
2 CONC MOSES persisted. "What's your name? Who are you?" And God replied with a voice like thunder: "I Am Who I Am   that's who I am!" (Exodus 3:14). To the modern ear that sounds a bit like 'mind 
2 CONC your own business'. Not to mention being the catchphrase of Popeye The Sailor Man. But in fact it was a devastating affirmation of God's existence and majesty. MOSES quailed before the Lord and said "okay, 
2 CONC fair enough". Now things get confusing. The Old Testament was written in ancient Hebrew, which has no vowels whatsoever and precious little punctuation. The phrase 'I Am Who I Am'  God's name as 
2 CONC revealed to MOSES  is written with four consonants: Y H W H. Hence YHWH = I Am Who I Am. These four letters are known as the Tetragrammaton and they contain a divine mystery: no-one knows how to pronounce 
2 CONC them. The Hebrew people didn't dare speak aloud the Name of God. It was a name of such awesome holiness and majesty that no mortal tongue was allowed to utter it. The priests imagined what might 
2 CONC happen if they sneezed or burped while saying it and shuddered with dread. To avoid blasphemy, other words were substituted, such as 'Adonai' (Ruler), or 'Ha Shem' (The Name). Even today, Bibles depict 
2 CONC the Name of God with the euphemism 'Lord' instead of his actual moniker. Orthodox Jews even censor their own euphemisms, fearing blasphemy should someone come along later and scribble over a reference 
2 CONC to God. (The invention of computers presented an even trickier problem for Orthodox Jews; if you type the word 'God', is it blasphemy to edit it? If a text file contains the word 'God', is it blasphemy 
2 CONC to delete it? What about spam emails containing the word. Are you stuck with them forever? It isn't easy being devout.) The correct pronunciation of Y H W H eventually sank into obscurity through 
2 CONC disuse  and now it's lost forever. There has been much linguistic research and archeological speculation on the subject, but of course ancient Hebrew had no vowels so we'll never be sure. Nowadays the 
2 CONC name YHWH is written YAHWEH, which at least looks nicer. You are free to pronounce it how you wish. If there ever was a Bible Code, try solving it without vowels.   Entry last modified on 20 July 2005

2 CONC creation, at least as understood by DAOists. This includes the Moon, darkness, weakness, submission, modesty, stillness, poverty and sickness. That may sound negative, and in fact it is. YIN is the negative 
2 CONC to YANG's positive. But there is no true negative as both forces are equal and opposite, perfect in their differences. True fulfilment comes when you embrace both YIN and YANG in equal measure, 
2 CONC as each complements and benefits the other. If you strive after something without accepting its opposite, things fall out of balance. This can lead to ill health, bad luck and all manner of spiritual 
2 CONC unhappiness. If this happens to you, your manifestation of DAO probably needs fine-tuning and your QI adjusted. Consult your nearest FENG-SHUI practioner. Meanwhile, back to the Gods. The Heavenly personification

2 CONC a mysterious MUSPELL fire appeared nearby and he started to perspire. The first man and woman were formed from the sweat between his arms  and we understand they were particularly keen to get out of 
2 CONC his armpit at that point. Second, his legs gave birth to a son. We know not how. We only report the facts. And third, a giant cow called AUDUMBLA appeared out of the ice offering a selection of delicious 
2 CONC sorbets. Shortly after that, BURI  the first God  was born. The rest is history. YMIR was viciously slaughtered by his grandson ODIN and his gigantic body was broken up for scrap. His blood became 
2 CONC the sea, his bones became the mountains and his eyebrows became MIDGARD, the world of men. Fear not  nothing went to waste. Incidentally, the clouds in the sky were made from his brains, a notion we're 
2 CONC rather fond of. When you look upwards, you're seeing his passing thoughts.  Entry last modified on 07 June 2005

2 CONC General Meeting of Snakes and Serpents, he was accused of eating his kin and throwing the good name of snakes into disrepute. Not one to go against the status quo, YRLUNGGUR admitted his error and 
2 CONC offered to make amends. The WAWALUG sisters were promptly thrown up in a heap of vomit, as good as new and demanding compensation. We understand there was an out-of-court settlement. Meanwhile, YRLUNGGUR

1 NOTE Also known as YU-CH'IANGYU-QIANG: God of the Oceans and the Ocean Winds. Once upon a long time ago, there were five islands for the immortals. These were not anchored to the Earth and floated freely, 
2 CONC but they kept bumping into China. The Gods were not too happy with having their joss sticks jostled and moaned to the JADE-EMPEROR. YU-QIANG was ordered to tether the islands to a team of turtles, who 
2 CONC could take it in turns to bear their weight. Then there was some hassle with a giant, who caught and ate most of the turtles, causing two of the islands to sink. Only one is left, but we don't know where 
2 CONC it is. As God of Sea Breezes, YU-QIANG has a bird body with human face and appendages, but when the God of Seawater he rides on two dragons and something fishy happens, turning him into a whale. 
2 CONC When angry he turns back into a giant bird, although this should exclude him from tying turtles to islands because, in our opinion, the turtles would be scared witless.  Entry last modified on 15 April

2 CONC with a God who is eternal, limitless and invisible. There is no background to fall back on. He created all the backgrounds. His distinguished career has gone largely unnoticed in the Western World where 
2 CONC titles such as 'The Celestial Venerable Of the Primordial Beginning' are beyond the comprehension of those who have suffered a comprehensive education. Legend tells that he existed before everything, 
2 CONC having formed himself from pure QI energy. Then he created Heaven and Earth and ruled over all  at least for a while. At some point his reluctance to be scrutable led him to take on an apprentice 
2 CONC so he could retire to perfect contemplation. So the young JADE-EMPEROR learned the trade of Universal Mastery and became ruler of everything, while YUAN-SHI-TIAN-ZONG relocated to the Pure Jade Heaven 
2 CONC for a million billion trillion years of navel-gazing. We understand he is still available for consultations and soul-saving, but only in an emergency.  Entry last modified on 27 November 2005

2 CONC it was the old old story of losing his wife, going blind, losing his mistress, becoming a beggar and getting burnt to ashes in the kitchen stove. However, as luck would have it, there was a vacancy 
2 CONC for a Kitchen God and he got the job, helped by the piety of his grieving mistress. Now he can be found in every household, keeping an eye on things and offering protection. Something of a celestial

1 NOTE greek mythology
1 NOTE Also known as CENEUS, EPIPHANESZEUS: Top God of the Earth and Ruler of Mount Olympus, the lofty cloudland where the Greek Gods live and look down upon mankind. He is a real high-flyer, an Olympic champion, 
2 CONC battling with the giant TITANS, casting thunderbolts and engaged in all manner of gut-busting glorious Godly pursuits. His father CRONUS was so terrified of the newborn baby ZEUS's awesome power 
2 CONC that he swallowed him up. And lived to regret it. It was left to AMALTHEA (and her goat) to protect the budding SuperGod while he learned to walk, talk, and rule the Universe. Since then he's never looked 
2 CONC back. ZEUS is married to the long-suffering HERA, but spends most of his time lusting after Goddesses, mortals, animals, and indeed anything that will keep still long enough. It's tough at the top 
2 CONC being the most fantastic hunky irresistible God of all time and having constantly to prove it. And never a quiet night in with slippers and a mug of cocoa because he has to keep his long-suffering 
2 CONC wife HERA happy too. Their trials and tribulations form the basis of half the Greek entries in our database. ZEUS has had so many mistresses and fathered so many children that there's no point in giving 
2 CONC a list here. Just take our word for it. See also CRONUS, RHEA, HEPHAESTUS, ATHENA... and in fact most of the other Greek Gods. Moving on to more Godly matters, ZEUS was also known to the ancient Greeks 
2 CONC as Epiphanes, the Magnificent One, whenever a certain star appeared in the east. This was celebrated with piph-ups known as epiphanies. When he's not running around after nubile Goddesses in the 
2 CONC form of a lusty animal, ZEUS looks after Law, upholds Justice, and casts thunderbolts on those deserving it.  Entry last modified on 01 January 2006

2 CONC was one of the Three Brothers of the Peach Orchard along with GUAN-YU and LIU-BEI. The three of them were a sort of Dynamic Duo plus one, or less than half of a Magnificent Seven. Pledging to save the 
2 CONC Empire from rebels and war, they plunged into the fray and performed many mighty deeds. ZHANG-FEI himself was a meat distributor by trade. He started out with animals and ended up with humans, but the 
2 CONC principle is the same. A large, bellowing butcher of a general, he charged in regardless of danger, lost his temper every sixteen minutes and was liable to explode with fury whenever an underling dared 
2 CONC to speak. Little wonder that ZHANG-FEI was eventually killed by his own men. Steer well clear of sausages from now on.  Entry last modified on 12 November 2005

1 NOTE chinese mythology
1 NOTE Also known as CHANG-HSIENZHANG-XIAN: God of Birth and Protector of Children. But only of the male variety. He also has a hand in Food Production. The birth of male children was traditionally of prime 
2 CONC importance to Chinese families. Boys grew up to become men. Girls were just girls  nice to have around, so long as there were plenty of boys to make the money and work the farms. Which is why ZHANG-XIAN 
2 CONC became the top God to turn to for offspring. He was constantly in demand for supplying male children. As far as we know, there is no Chinese God of female offspring, so it's possible he now offers 
2 CONC a unisex service. Known as the Archer, ZHANG-XIAN is usually depicted firing an arrow in the direction of TIAN-GU, the Celestial God. We understand he is also the mortal enemy of ER-LANG, the heroic nephew 
2 CONC of the JADE-EMPEROR. These facts require further investigation.  Entry last modified on 16 April 2004

1 NOTE chinese mythology
1 NOTE Also known as CHIH-NU, CHIH-HIIZHI-NU: Goddess of Weaving, Spinning and Crafts. The daughter of the JADE-EMPEROR, she spends all her time spinning beautiful silk robes and lacey garments for the Heavenly 
2 CONC Host. She also makes the finest gossamer clouds and her tapestry of the constellations is a work of art. Her father was so pleased with ZHI-NU's diligent work that he married her to the Heavenly Official 
2 CONC In Charge Of Cowsheds. (That may not sound like much of a reward, but then you haven't met him.) The two of them fell headlong in love and pretty soon she was getting behind in her spinning duties. 
2 CONC So they were whisked off into the sky and separated by the Milky Way. You can still see them there; she is Vega in the constellation Lyra and he is Altair in the constellation Aquila.Now they are 
2 CONC only allowed to meet once a year, when a flock of magpies swarm into the sky and create a bridge for them to cross. For the rest of the year they live apart and she is the Heavenly Spinster in more 
2 CONC ways than one. This is what comes of a marriage made in Heaven. Now some versions of this tale assert that ZHI-NU actually came down to Earth and had her clothes stolen while she bathed in a river. The 
2 CONC culprit was NIU-LANG, a humble cowherd who was amazed at her beauty and fell instantly in love. Without her clothes she could not return to Heaven  at least, not without some very awkward questions 
2 CONC being asked. So she decided to marry him instead as he was sweet and gentle, and not bad looking for a mortal. Of course Heaven found out eventually, and whisked them off to the stars as before. It doesn't 
2 CONC really matter which version is true. The end of this story is far more important than the beginning, as all Chinese lovers will testify. The seventh day of the seventh lunar month is when ZHI-NU 
2 CONC and NIU-LANG cross the magpie bridge. Their stars burn brightly in the Heavens, lovers hold hands and gaze into the night sky, and Chinese Valentine's Day begins...  Entry last modified on 15 April 2004

2 CONC with alchemy, and became a bit of a hermit to pursue the esoteric. His peaceful dabbling came to an end when one particularly esoteric experiment caused an explosion in his dwelling. The walls shook 
2 CONC and a large crack appeared, exposing to view a hidden container. This contained a goodly dosage of the Elixir Of Life. Whether it was in tablet or liquid form we can't say, but it more than compensated 
2 CONC for the damage. Because ZHONG-LIQUAN, who it would seem would try anything once, became an Immortal. Perhaps because of his explosive capabilities, he is also the God of Military Operations. For

2 CONC claim. There was nothing remotely suitable, so the Heavenly Judges had to create a post specially for him: God of Sodomy. To curtail his activities he was only granted a single temple at Weihui

2 CONC After much bickering and insult-throwing, the two of them elected to settle their differences in true Godly fashion. They decided to fight it out. The battle raged across Heaven for days, causing great

2 CONC doubt be extremely glad to get here. Escape! Freedom! At least, of a sort. Taking into account your crimes and repentance, ZHUANG-LUN-WANG will decide what form your next incarnation will take. Most

2 CONC may find yourself reborn as an ape, a dog, a pig or even a slug. We're suprised facts like these are not more widely publicised. It would greatly reduce the crime rate. Once ZHUANG-LUN-WANG has decided

1 NOTE chinese mythology
1 NOTE Also known as TZU-KU, TZU-KU-SHENZI-GU: Goddess of Toilets. One of the LAVATORY-LADIES, she started out as the beautiful wife of an actor during the Tang Dynasty. All was good until a high-ranking minister 
2 CONC named Li-Jing fell in love with her, killed her husband, and took the unfortunate ZI-GU to be his mistress. His wife was insanely jealous. One day, while ZI-GU was taking what can only be described 
2 CONC as a delicate pee, Li-Jing's wife leapt out from behind a pile of toilet paper and murdered her in cold blood. From that moment, Li-Jing's lavatory was haunted by the ghost of his ex-mistress. Strange 
2 CONC spooky noises emanated from the closet at all hours, and even the most stout-hearted visitor would cross his legs and wait till he got home. When the news got out, Empress Wu, concerned for the kidneys 
2 CONC of her top minister, blessed the ghost of ZI-GU and elevated her to Godly status. The haunting of the lavatory immediately ceased. (We believe this kind of exorcism is known as a Royal Flush.) 
2 CONC The grateful spirit of ZI-GU ascended to Heaven and the toilet was safe to use once more. Life went back to normal. But Li-Jing's wife was never able to eat roughage again. As Goddess of Toilets, ZI-GU 
2 CONC appears in the form of a beautiful contemplative woman, her lower body wrapped discreetly in clouds. This soothing image is a far cry from the typical Chinese hole in the ground, but that's mythology 
2 CONC for you. Perhaps due to the thoughtful navel-gazing which takes place in the bathroom, ZI-GU is also known as the Goddess of Spirit Writing. She inspires mediums with messages from the Astral Plane. 
2 CONC That's why mediums never take a newspaper into the bathroom. No need for a crystal ball. Incidentally, ZI-GU's favorite color is purple. This would seem to be the ideal choice when it comes to decorating 
2 CONC the bathroom. However, as we know from experience, purple lavatory paper is almost impossible to get hold of.  Entry last modified on 24 June 2006
